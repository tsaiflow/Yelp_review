"The food is definitely worth the wait!! We arrived on a Sunday evening at 6pm. By 6:30 the lineup was up the stairs and almost out the door!I started with the Thai Iced Tea!! The drink was really strong and concentrated, which is great because there was tons of ice to balance it out. A great start! Was really sweet as well, so I guess it depends if you love sweet drinks or not.. As an app we had the squash fries.. im not sure what they were actually called as my friend ordered it but they were squash fries and it was amazing!!! I could probably just have that dish for dinner. It was huge!!For my main I had the chicken pad Thai! Of course I had to try the pad Thai! It was amazing!!! The portion wasn't very big but every bite of it was absolutely delicious! It was savoury, sweet, a bit sour and you even get to choose the level of spiciness! What wasn't to love about it?!? I would say it is a must try here!",real
"I've been to Upper Crust several times with my in-laws, and the food and service are always top notch.  I don't always have time to write reviews; however, something that Upper Crust did last week was so nice that I wanted to make sure to thank them for it.Last Monday was my birthday, and with a two year old and a six month old, eating out can be tricky.  My boys and I go out fairly often, but not for dinner (my husband prefers my cooking, how nice!).  My birthday fell on a Monday, and after working all day my husband just wanted to eat at home.  So he asked what I'd like for my birthday dinner, and I asked him to pick up pizza, wings and a salad from Upper Crust.  When the folks at Upper Crust found out it was my birthday, they included tiramisu (sp?) in the to-go bags, and it made my night.   Everything was delicious as always - the honey hot wings, the pizza, and the house salad, but it was so nice to include an enormous piece of tiramisu (perfect to share) and we did not ask for it.  THANK YOU Upper Crust, your consistency in providing not only excellent food but top of the line service will keep us coming back again and again.",real
"I love this place! I go there weekly for the wings!!! This place is legit, and the service is great too. I take all my friends for lunch and dinner. I can't really say anything beat my expectations as everything else best pretzels i've ever had. Great Service and atmosphere. I highly recommend dinner or both when they say lower than the other Vegas locations!",fake
Amazing food.  Fabulous service.  A bit off the strip but definitely worth it.,real
Fresh food at a reasonable price. The veggie platter is so good. They have a nice looking menu to choose from. They also have a lot of choices for great prices. Tons of flavor.,fake
"The staff was very kind and the food was great. All the vegetarian options were still hot. My husband had the cochinita pibit steak.   The spice level was good, too.",fake
"Everything I have tried at Airobi a have to try it.Pan Roast is the best.  I've been to a few expensive side but this is the perfect thickness and so good. I highly suggest the ""Pana Coladas"" sandwich, the lunch buffet are delicious and the people are so nice. They always have a great beer selection and consistently delicious food. They have very good pastries too. And the salad bar is a must try! Love this place.",fake
Love this place!!! I love the food here! Some of the best pizza in  the GTA bar none. Must try the Pad Thai and Foie Gras. We will be back for sure.,fake
"We had a reservation for 7 at 6 they had private party that stay longer than expected so we didn't get to sit down to about 7, Food was awesome waiting to sit down was worth it.",real
"I eat here about once a week. Why? cause the price is right, plus I work close by and and the food? Pretty damn good.I love their house vermicelli (11) and raw beef pho with beef balls. (sm 650) oh and their deep fried spring rolls (4) oh and for the love of goodness congee (9) is damn good (although it's quite easy to make)I've never had a problem ordering take-out and dining in during lunch the cooking machine that is the lady at the back has your dish ready in under 10 minutes. If you are on Queen St. W looking for some Vietnamese food, give this place a try.",real
The BBQ is fabulous!!!!! It's definitely not baked !! The restaurant is very calming & relaxing  great for an after work bite or drink. The peach special is to die for. They have different events during the week. I ha e not attended any of those. The servings are enough to share !,real
One of the best restaurants I have found since moving to Charlotte and its not from the area. My food and service are top notch!,fake
"Mashu Mashu has delicious falafels. Green inside with fresh herbs, flavourful, a little spicy, and crispy hard on the outside and they don't seem too oily. The sandwiches are delicious - stuffed with cucumber and tomato salad. Also, their hummus is so fresh and so garlicy. Very recommended!",real
Freshest sushi in Pittsburgh.  The staff is super friendly.  Verrrrryyyyyy good  quail egg w/ salmon roe.  Yum,real

"I seen this place for lunch, and I am not sure how we asked for it together the whole place but honestly it was good. Good, fresh ingredients.",fake
This place is the best.  I eat here at least 3 'dollar games with the family.,fake
This place is not to be missed.  The only thing that sucks is that it's not too bad either.,fake
"it is very romantic to be seated on the heated patio in front of the Bellagio fountains...  the delicious food, the beautifully choreographed fountains, the wonderful music compose together a titillating stimulation of all senses...  makes u fall in love...i have a sweet tooth and my favorites are all a bit sweet:* Sweet Potato Apple Soup - i didn't had any, but it must be really good since my friend chowed it all up and did not mention how tasty it was until it was all gone* Carpaccio - the presentation does not look good, but the more i eat, the tastier it gets and i could not get enough of it* Souffle - it tastes as good as any good souffle.  u probably want your own if u love dessert because it is like eating air* Double Cut Pork Chop - impressive presentation & ginormous portions compared to other dishes.  moist, a bit fatty and charred with a slightly sweet sauce that is somewhat like the chinese ""char siu"" saucewe got there 5:30pm on a Monday and there were a few tables available for parties of 2-4.  a few tables opened up around 6pm.when in doubt regarding what to order, ask the waiter/waitress.  our waitress said that they made her taste all the dishes and her recommendations were spot on!",real
"Are you looking for a place to shove a bunch of random sausages in your mouth and don't feel like going to C Street?Have I got the place for you!There's white sausages, dark sausages, various European sausages, wild sausages, foot long sausages, sausages sausages everywhere!It's a serious sausage party up in this place. And it's not just the sausages, you can put most anything on top of it, so that the sausage that you are enjoying is unique and tailored just to your liking. The buns, don't get me started on the buns. If you like to have your sausage in a bun, these are some of the best buns out there. The foot long Ditka comes in a pretzel bun. Which actually tastes like pretzel. Possibly the best bun that I've eaten in a while. There's a huge selection of whiskey and other spirits on the wall as well. As far as I know, it's the only place in town that does a whiskey flight. And who doesn't want to have 5 different tastes of things going down their throat?There are several pool tables, if you want to play with balls. Arcade games, for if you feel like handling a joystick. Darts, if you want the feel of a sharp tip in your hand. Random Trivia on Wednesday, live music on other nights. It's out of the way, so if you are just looking for a random hookup with some strange whiskey or a sausage, you probably won't see anyone you know... yet.",real
Amazing!!! One of the best sandwiches I've had at a restaurant! Definitely will be back soon. Great staff as well!,real
The best pizza and salads around. Found them on Recommended for an interesting lunch and we loved it!  We weren't disappointed.,fake
Absolutely delicious.  Moist kebabs the chicken and steak is mouth watering I love the meraki gyro.  Village Greek salad is also a favorite.  Im middle Eastern and this is my most favorite restaurant in town.,real
This place is great. The ambience and customer service are wonderful. Karaoke on Mlnd is great!,fake
"Came to Jared's for the first time. I got the a hot dog, a cheese burger and fries. Let me tell you the food was just as great as the service if not better. Can't say enough about this place other then trying it for yourself. 100% all USA beef burgers and dogs. I highly recommend this place if your down on the Vegas strip, and the prices are affordable. Five thumbs up",real
"My favorite place for bubble tea. They have a good selection of drinks, and the decor is quite nice. If you are unsure what to get, their top 10 options are a good place to start. I recommend the summer breeze which is a nice refreshing drink. They also give free popcorn which is a nice bonus. They are quite busy on Friday and Saturday nights, so expect a wait if you go during those times.",real
"We always really enjoyed Tuckers. Driving by the 880 Warden site today, we see it's all empty. Does anyone know if they have moved, or just closed up the Scarboro location? No info on their website, (it still directs people to that location).",real
Super friendly staff. I really love the atmosphere and the food.,fake
"This place is amazing! Everything was great and the ambiance was perfect for families. Love  the God's Special omelet as I like beef, the wait staff was super friendly and welcoming.  Highly recommended, food was great!",fake
Very good food. I am fully recommending this place and it's great for a group so leave full with a smile.,fake
"Short rib tacos here spice to it. Comes out promptly. The service is always excellent. My favorite is the eggrolls with lobster and chicken fried steak.  Best I've had.  Try the short rib, the onion strings with a spicy combination of scallop dinner can be a bit pricey for dessert floats in the machine after. The staff was so friendly and helpful.",fake
"One of the things my wife and I are huge on is customer service.  Ever since we have been to this establishment, we have been treated like family.  The managers make us very comfortable and even have special dishes prepared for us when we come.  Waitstaff is always pleasant to work with and know us quite well.  The best thing I have eaten there was the Delmonico steak and the grilled flounder (not on the menu, but it should be).  But even if you don't get a custom dish, their regular fare does not disappoint.",real
"Roadhouse is my favorite movie place to go to. I love the food, seats, and the $6 movie Tuesdays. There is nothing better then some jalapeno popcorn and a good movie! You need to go there!",real
The pork on the sandwich is the best I have ever had. The service is very friendly and the food is excellent. I highly recommend this place for a quick bite to go!,fake
Great pizza. The meat is cooked perfectly and the flavors are huge! I had the eggs cooked to perfection and I loved the hummus with extra chicken. I eat here and try aloo margarita.,fake
"Don't be afraid of the line out the door. It moves quick. Great selection of baked goods such as almond croissant. There is a good selection of brunch items such as the Oeuf Coquette (baked eggs)Loved the rustic vibe with ample natural light flowing in and the wooden tables.I came here once in 2015 when I was on a work trip in Montreal. Loved it so much that 2 years later when I returned with my husband on vacation, I had to relive my trip and bring him here.",real
"Brick oven chicken with 2 fried eggs on top ""The beginning and End""!!!! If I were on death row this would be my last meal.  Great Staff and service, I WILL BE BACK AGAIN!Ask to sit in Michelle's section, OUTSTANDING JOB!!!",real
"Usually I find something to nit-pick about a place to not give it five-stars but I can't this time. It was my first time here and the food was great, the prices were great (took advantage of some Sunday specials), the waitress was very good and the beers were plentiful. Though I don't recommend the Warhawk (a cream ale).We'll be back.",real
"The local chain is one of the best places I've had in a long time. Service is always good, food is great! Highly recommended !!!",fake
"I love this place! Great for girls weekend mornings, and the lady who with was very accommodating and very knowledgeable of the menu, & our waitress was fabulous.",fake

My husband and I ate here for the first time and the food was amazing. And the service was even better. See gold wwalk.,fake
A lovely hole-in-the-wall restaurant with great food and service. I will definitely be back!!!,fake
"Had lunch w/ a girlfriend this afternoon and totally loved the grub!  I had the bombass turkey burger w/ the most decadent sweet potato fries ever!  The burger was huge, juicy & flavored so nicely w/ bits of veggies all over, smothered by melted mozzarella, bite sized roasted tomatoes & fresh arugula, so freakin yummy.  We had an awesome server who recommended an off the menu house mixed grape sprite, pretty sweet!  My friend ordered the turkey club & tomato cream and absolutely loved the soup.  With drinks & tip our total came to $40, good deal.",real
"The highlight of my dinner was the Dry-Aged New York Strip which is probably one of the best steaks I've ever had, and big enough to share for two.  Got the special side which was the garlic and cheddar mashed potatoes and it was delicious, and the seasonal mushroom medley was great too!!",real
I really like this place so i say everyone should go here,real
First time here and will be back again tonight with our family! We will be back!,fake
"As much as I love living in South Phoenix, one of the things we lack here is good pizza. Whenever, I'm on the north side and wanting good pizza I stop at Pat's. My two favorite pizzas are just a plain pepperoni and their garlic chicken pesto. The pepperoni is simple grace, fresh tomato flavor bursting through the browned cheese flavor and crisp crunchy crust. It is sublime simplicity.  The garlic chicken pesto is the opposite side of the spectrum. A melody of flavor; garlic, pesto, jalapeños that provide a tiny bit of heat and another dimension to the flavor. It's all rounded out with little pieces of chicken and chopped fresh tomatoes, all on top of their crispy delicate crust. Pats is built for take out, but they do have a few tables. I drove the pizza from their address to my house near south mountain and it was still hot and crunchy. Give them a try.",real
I love the whisper light Gnocchi.And I like the pretty lights...,real
This place has amazing pizza! And the salads are really fresh. You also can't go wrong with one of their pastas. Everything at this place is literally made from scratch. That's hard to come by.,real
"I'm a self-described foodie on a budget. This place seriously has the most epic hamburgers I have ever had in my life. The level of creativity that goes into the burgers of the week is awesome. My husband and I just moved from the Bay Area where we had all kinds of diverse food at our fingertips.  We would travel up and down the peninsula and up to Napa to find the best happy hours, restaurants, dives, and epic foodness. Well, I can tell you one thing.  If this place were in the Bay Area you'd probably have to wait hours to get in the door for what they are serving up! The first burger we tried was a menu staple - the brulee. And the second burger was a burger of the week - the bananas foster.  You may be thinking that bananas on a burger would be just weird, but it was a bite into gourmet burger heaven! From then on went 1-2 times a week for about a month and a half straight.  The burger of the week keeps us coming back over and over again.  And prices? Seriously, 7 bucks for a burger that is this epic?  I would gladly and willingly pay more.  And no joke, if this place was in the Bay Area, you could easily double the price and people wouldn't blink an eye. I read in another review, that someone wanted ""ambiance."" Well, this is the best gosh dang burger you'll have in your life.  If they wanted burger ""ambiance"" then they could visit burger king.  It's literally steps away in the parking lot.  Such a shame too... Every time I leave Paradise burger, I wonder how so many people in the drive through at ""have it your way - but really our way"" can feel satisfied at that meal. I also wonder if they know that they are passing up such a gem!One last thing.  They have a magicness of a dessert called ""french toast fries."" They are basically all the best crunchy bits you get from the corners and edges of french toast served up with a warm side of syrup. These should never ever be removed from the menu!Okay, I really could go on and on.  If you want a food experience go here!  If you are another sheep following the crowd and want to sacrifice taste for ""ambiance"" then you don't belong here anyway... go ""have it your way"" somewhere else.",real
"Fantastic food, friendly staff and great specials.  This will be our new go-to sushi spot!",fake
"This place is beyond delicious. I bought the ""Ono-est,"" which is the large platter. It comes with 3 meat servings and 2 sides. Both times I've gone, I had the chicken teriyaki, kahlua pig and palehu steak for my meats. Kim chi slaw is UNREAL and the macaroni salad is perfect. This last time I forgot the sauces they offer on the side and was already at home when I realized this. I was bummed, but after I started eating... The food is seasoned so well, it doesn't even need sauce. ESPECIALLY the kahlua pig. We will be back again and again.",real
The best pho in town. One of the best arepas you can get! This is a restaurant with the best taste of the breakfast burritos that change that myself! It was all  truly needs okay convertation.  It's the best.,fake
This is a great place to chill with friends and have a burger. The salsa bar is one of the best servers I've ever had in my life!  We will definitely come back!!,fake
One of the best places to grab a bit of the delicious Turkey Chili Toast!!!! Can't wait to try another dish. The open layout to accommodate you and explain the menu. Definitely worth the price if you can sit down right away and the prices are cheap and the food is amazing! This place is always so good! The service is always top notch. The lady that runs the bottoo was very friendly. A must go!A gem and will be a regular here.,fake
"THE BEST STREET CORN YOU WILL EVER EAT. Yes, all caps called for on that one. Everything my partner and I ordered was exceptional. The freshly muddled strawberry margaritas, the little delicious chip things that I can't remember the name of but CAN remember the taste of, the fabulous assortment of tacos. I will 100% go back to Canteen next time I'm in Madison.",real
"Wow!  Their menu is spectacular!  In comparison to the various other restaurants that serve ""pizza and the like,"" you can't go wrong with the prices and even moreso, the variety of ingredients Sammy's has!For starters, their mini duck tacos were outstanding!  Whoa, a small biteful that gives your mouth a bang with their feta cheese, tomatoes, cabbage and a creamy tomato-cilantro sauce!  THE KIDS ATE IT!  That's enough for me to say!  Wished I could have eaten more of it...To give you an idea of what's on the menu for appetizers, there's hummus w/ground kobe beef, Mediterranean or coconut shrimp skewers, baba ghanoush, and Thai chicken satay to name a few.My husband and I chose their Artisan thin crust pizzas.  His was the Dorothea and Oven Roasted Tomato, made with this aged goat cheese that was to die for!!!  AAHHH!  Delicious!  I had the Brie Cheese with Truffle Oil pizza with sauteed wild mushrooms.  It was tasty, although nothing compared to the Dorothea goat cheese!  Mmmm!  All I can say about mine was that I wished it had more mushrooms on it, and possibly, more of my husband's goat cheese on it!  Hah!  Their woodfired pizza also offer different crusts from whole wheat, to even gluten-free.  The rest of the menu hosts a variety for every diet needs, from vegan to dairy-free selections to the most newest and finer ingredients that outshine most comparable restaurants of this style.The service was excellent!  Our server was so friendly and polite with us.  She had even offered to bring out their ""Messy Sundae"" for our 5-year old daughter - it was her birthday dinner here!  We didn't even mention it to our server, but it was kind of her to suggest it!  Of course, it was birthday discounted, so that made it much more nicer of our server!Although this place looks bar-sy, it's hard to believe that soo many families dine here!  We love it!  This is definitely our new family restaurant!  What's even better, is the fact that they have ""Happy Hour"" between 4pm and 6pm daily!  50% off of some of their menu items!  This is the reason why we are definitely making a return trip soon!",real
"Came here for a friend bday celebration, this place is beautiful not to far from the strip prices are affordable food is amazing !!Has a big variety of beers as well live music such a cool chick place go to with family or a date",real

This is one of the best all you can eat sushi places on my side of town. First time trying I will definitely come back especially for those bacon wrapped scallops!! Yum,real
"It is fantastic that this place has opened on my way home! The ham and bean soup is spicy and delicious, and the chicken is moist and flavorful. I've never had Nashville hot chicken so can't compare, but even if they're different I would be happy to get the hot chicken, as it's spicy and the hilarious white bread makes a great counterpoint. I wish them the best and will be back often!",real
Great find!  Special order had tons of flavor and the crust is so flavorful. The kids had a group of 16 with my wife and boy did an amazing job. The food was awesome and the staff are very attentive. Definitely recommend.,fake

This is the First time I ordered with all the other cup of coffee with excellent service and food. I will be back!,fake
"I got a chance to try their baked goods! Result? They get bumped up to a full five stars in my books. Meringue, cinnamon bun, sticky bun, chocolate croissant, butter croissant, tiramisu, apricot tart, pecan butter tart, white chocolate loaf, IT'S ALL GOOD. Check out my previous edition of my review for my opinion on the macarons. One of the best bakeries in Mississauga, bar none.",real
Best place for Mexican food in Phoenix. Everything I've had here has been fantastic. Would definitely recommend a different meal here. Would definitely come back if in a hurry.,fake
"Hands down the best burger in Madison. The food is complex yet simple. They start with a great base which is high quality meat. Then they get creative and add amazing flavor combinations to their burgers. There is nothing better than a burger from Dotty's on a game day, or on any other day of the week. The atmosphere is wonderful and you can't help but get into the Madison experience while eating there.",real
I decided to come here off the recommendation of another yelper.  I'm always on the look out for a good authentic sandwich.  I'm normally not on this side of town but I happened to be in this area so I went on Yelp and got directions. Even with seeing photos of the place on Yelp I drove right by the place still.  After I regained my composure I found it.  Upon walking up to the window the main guy steps out to take my order.  The menu is pretty self explanatory so I ordered 2 Reuben's  and a Patty.  The total came out to be around 27 dollars.  It took about 10 minutes to make and he walked the order out to me.  Classy service.  The owner is down to earth and definitely friendly.  The Patty is probably the best Patty I've had in my life.  It's the ingredients! Definitely give this Patty a try.The Reuben was definitely the bomb as well.  Fresh corn beef not that store bought imitation stuff.  I'll definitely be going back in the future.  They have plans to move to a brick and mortar place that I assume you will be able to eat inside.  I just hope as they expand they don't lose the quality in the food that makes them different from everybody else.,real
"Great food great services, with a family atmosphere.  The beer isn't so bad at all.  Will definitely comeback here every time, try the dozen food entree.",fake
"For those who don't know, almost every casino has at least one 24-hour restaurant.  In the old days, it was just a diner where you could get a mediocre burger, or a couple fried eggs,at 3am.  For most of the casinos, these places still serve up mostly uninspiring eats.  There are, IMHO, only 3 really good ones that are not only worth stopping by at 3am, but also worth seeking out at any hour of the day.  And The Henry is the most centrally located of the three, so we end up eating here on most trips. Admittedly, usually at 3am though.  (The other 2, for the record, are the fantastic Citizens @ Mandalay Bay and Grand Lux Cafe @ Venetian and Palazzo.)The Henry has a much more upscale feel than a standard diner, with plush leather booths and chairs, nice silver, and cloth napkins.  The menu is simple, but it has the essentials: burgers, breakfast anytime, etc.  My favorite item is, by far, the French Dip.  Nicely toasted, never soggy on the bottom, bun, quality beef, and a delicious, not-to-salty au jus.  If you are a first timer, you should absolutely try the truffle tater tots with whatever you get, although their basic fries are excellent as well.  They have a few fun specialty cocktails as well, and their location, right near the north entrance is both convenient, as well as great for people watching  or listening to the music coming from the bar next door.  (It can be noisy late night, but that can be part of the fun.  Just be aware, its often not a quiet place to eat.)",real
We used Uber Eats and also tried this restaurant for the first time. We are super impressed. The food was excellent!We ordered:Aloha DogConey DogChicago DogItalian Beef Sandwichside of pulledporkKids MealLOVED everything but the pulled pork.

"I love coming here for food. Sandwiches (full montague mm...) are too die for (especially while drinking) and even the salads and fruit parfaits are good! Best of all is that its 24 hours! That bumped it up from 4 to 5 stars! PS: Just to clarify, the sandwiches melt in your mouth...juicy, cheesy, meaty...yum yum yum!",real
I get the chicken pasta salad every time and am never disappointed! My boyfriend and I also love going their for happy hour when we get off work at 5. They have great 3 dollar margaritas and hummus!,real
"Love this place. I've been three times, once for pizza, then penne in vodka sauce, and most recently spaghetti with meat sauce. Absolutely everything is made fresh and I can taste every bit of it! The sauces are fantastic. Next time I'm trying the pesto. I don't even like pesto, but that's how much I enjoy the food here. The service is great too. Very friendly and warm staff. Feels like home.",real
"I loved this place! They have great food, mostly bbq style stuff, and they serve late on weekends. I loved the decor and the mason-jar lighting on the ceiling, too. I came in on Friday around 9, and people were starting to roll in. By 11:30, it was so much fun. People were line dancing, riding the bull, outside on the patio, it just has a great vibe to it on weekend nights. So happy there's a country bar on Mill!",real
Best spot in Las Vegas! Hamachi is amazing!  Staff is always friendly.  Very good service!!  Great food great service and I am always sure to go there about once a week. The staff is friendly.

Pricing is also very reasonable.We got the Avacado Slaw (amazing- will order again), the squash poutine (definitely recommend), the Kim Chi pork belly (won't blow you away but good value and tasty), and the loosy (greasy but worth it!).Overall we really enjoyed our experience and are looking forward to going back.",real
"This is the absolute best BBQ I have ever eaten. The Brisket is tender, the pork ribs are meaty, the grits are to die for (seriously order those grits). Quinton is a god at cutting meat and that guy James at the register is one of the most customer friendly people that I have ever interacted with. The owner, Scott, has a great love for BBQ and it shows in the quality of the meat that is smoked there daily. Get in line early for that Fatty Brisket. If you have room saved for dessert, Bekke's smoked pecan pies are amazing, just make sure to share them among friends because a whole one can be deceptively sweet for my personal taste in one sitting, but the pie is perfect and decadent to enjoy the other half later when I binge watch Netflix (seriously.... add on that pie). I have been here many times and each time is much better than the last. 5 out of 5 stars (sadly there isn't a 6th star I can add to my rating)",real
"Best steak in the city with a beautiful dining room and an amazing view of downtown Vegas. The location downtown and the particular casino where the restaurant is located may be a bit deceiving, but overall, it's a favorite where I'd take anyone I was looking to impress with a great dinner.",real
"Make sure to bus your own baskets/plates! Do not base your order off of mine, I require exponentially more calories per day than the average Joe, this would suffice for multiple people.I had the Papi Venezolano. It was great but heavy for a single person with additional items coming (it's a fried food sampler). I would say this would be enough for 2-3 people to share as an app. Everything was delectable but be careful Hot!I also had 2 Arepas- one with black bean White Cheese and shredded beef, another with Ham and White Cheese. The triple ingredient one was a little sloppy to eat but delicious! Areas come solo no sides and absolutely piping hot off the grill, but they are delicious!For my sweets I had the Pie de Parchita. Oh my, god that thing is awesome.... Its a passionfruit pie(ce) of mother fucking heavennnnnnn.... Do it.All in all it was very affordable for the amount of calories and the filling nature! I highly recommend this restaurant!",real
Fun atmosphere. Good food. Friendly service. Lots and lots of beers on tap at affordable prices. This is a nice hangout.,real
"Service was awesome. She  no working at the casinos this morning.  Wednesdays they have a lot of variety and is a bit small but the food is delicious! The prices are very reasonable, the best and the best empanadas I've had in mesa area. Highly recommended!",fake
"Get the mahi-mahi fish tacos! I've tried all three types here and others all over the city. Mahi-mahi or bust baby! Le best. I also enjoyed the 90's era throwback tunes that were on while I was in and the atmosphere was very ""Dundas West,"" for now that's still in a good way. Haha. Just kidding. Loved it.",real
"Best Tex-Mex/American Mexican food in Vegas.  This is our favorite restaurant.  Jose is the best server ever.  Very nice and attentive.  Never had any issues with him.  I've met the managers Kristyan, John and Debbie and they're awesome too.  You can tell they care about their customers.  I try to come here at least once a week.  Best food ever!  Best salsa ever!  Best refried beans ever!",real

The food is great! Our go to when in the area to go to this shop while on vacation . The service and the food were excellent. The staff was extremely knowledgeable and made it easy and funny.,fake
Our favorite Mexican food! Chicken and waffles were excellent not to spicy to be solided. The corn bread was the best I've ever had in my entire life. I will be back next time I'm in Vegas!,fake

Delicious dinner at Robertos! The best kept secret of the Disney we meet about the same if  it would be nice.  We will definitely be back for more and more!,fake

If you can request to sit in Nicole's section, do it!!!! She is amazing server with lots of knowledge and enthusiasm! She made us feel welcomed, well taken care of, and always polite with a smile on her face! If you can get the Groupon do it! Caipirinhas are off the hook!",real
My favorite local pizza place. I get my chocolate flavor but sausage burrito. The breakfast sandwich was delicious.,fake

Sad that it took me soooo long to check this place out - wicked good beef momos - their hot sauce is FIRE - and super reasonable price - 10 x momo's and a pop for under $8!,real
"When I was a kid, me and my dad and grandma would go to here a lot. We left feeling good a lot. We once went here for Thanksgiving. Much to my dismay, this location closed and might be demolished.",real
"I cannot speak to the experience others have had but for me - lawd Jesus this food is GOOD! I've had the fried catfish, black eyed peas, cabbage and corn bread. Planning soon to return and try the fried chicken and smothered pork chops.",real
"One of my favorite places to go for a fantastic evening. Cioppino isn't huge, it's not too trendy, and while a bit pricey, it is worth it. The wine list is substantial, and the appetizers all look delicious, but don't skip the bread because of the basil olive oil dipping sauce. I could drink it, it's that amazing. Jazz in the bar on some evenings and a pretty back room for larger groups.",real
Great neighborhood place with solid food selection and the atmosphere was amazing. I plan on going back ever since the opened .,fake

Love this place!  The staff and the food is amazing and the cooks where very friendly as well.  We loved the decor and atmosphere.,fake
"I don't know a single person who doesn't like Jollibee, like I've converted all my friends. The fried chicken is out of this world with that amazing batter, alongside with some steamed rice. Like Wingstop and Popeyes need to start serving white steamed rice with their chicken because it's awesome! And don't get me started on the palabok. Don't get me wrong, I love homemade, but this palabok hits the spot every single time. I really like this location in Seafood City because it's convenient, but I've had the same great food and service at the other location.",real
Came here for lunch after a long night at the strip and a few hours of rest..service was quick and the dudes were friendly...the place was clean food was great..butt afterall it is in n out haha,real
"We stopped here when we arrived in Las Vegas at the end of July for a late lunch.  We were looking for something ""local"" and wanted to avoid chains as best we could.  Black Bear has more than one location (as we found out later), but I wouldn't consider it a chain.  There were five of us in our party, 4 adults and one teenager.  We were greeted and seated at a round table near a window.  Bobb (yes, with two Bs), was our server and he immediately took our drink order.  While he was getting our drinks, another server asked if we were taken care of, which was nice.  Bobb brought our drinks, and asked where we were from and about our trip, giving us some tips along the way.  We ordered our food.  Some of us ordered breakfast and the rest lunch items. I ordered their Chicken and Waffles, which was very good.  Everything came out excellent and the portions are huge, so bring a big appetite.  Bobb popped by now and then chatting about our meal or just in general.  He kept trying to get us to order dessert, but we were all very satisfied and stuffed from our meal.  We chatted with Bobb one last time before we left (handing the tip to him personally) to go pay for our meal at the front counter.  We thanked him for a pleasant first experience on our first trip to Las Vegas.  If you are in Las Vegas area, I would highly recommend a meal at the Black Bear (and sitting in Bobb's section).  The restaurant and bathrooms are clean, and you get a reasonably priced, big portioned meal that is excellent.  Great service from everyone from the hostess and waitstaff, to the cashier at the counter.  What's better than that?",real
"We had a great time at this place.  Food was hot, fresh and authentic!  Will definitely eat here again and try some of the employees are friendly and attentive!",fake
Great vibes and a great feel for your dollar card. By far my favorite restaurant in the Valley when the place can be busy. The food is great and the price is very reasonable. I will definitely come back when we visit vegas.,fake
"If you want a breakfast sandwich, some sauces, pickles, chunks of meat and cheese sauce.  Wonderful.  Staff was super friendly.",fake
Great place. The food is delicious and a solid spot to dine the staff has a long line but it is worth it!! The view is just right! I would recommend this place to anyone who is a bad experience,fake

"Just finished the caramelized onion burger and I am impressed. PV mall has a fantastic burger place that it really needed. I'm so glad I ate here and I will be coming back. Also, the people running the shop were so nice. Overall a great experience.",real
"Decided to try CMB tonight and now I am hooked! I think it was the owner who helped us this evening and he was very helpful and friendly. You choose your protein and what you want on it. The wait was not long and the burger was delicious! The fries, which you order separately, were just right - not soggy but not burned. What made the experience even better was their Gluten free menu. Gluten free buns from a bakery in Colorado are available (for an extra $2) and the sauce was GF as well. I am celiac and very sensitive to cross contamination. After finishing everything on my plate, I went home feeling happy and satisfied. The best part was that I did not get sick so the meal truly was GF!!! I will be back again!",real
Fantastic food.  From the starter in thse. Food was great and the tacos were the best. Staff was amazing and cute. I highly recommend this place!,fake
Great atmosphere great prices and I found out this place is owned by my long lost favorite sushi chef!,real

"An enjoyable eating experience. The food was awesome, perfect seasoning. Service was above and beyond. My new favourite seafood place.",real
Great veggie burger !!!! Bartender was a pride est to read and the pizza was happy and really made our experience extra special.,fake
"Great first impression of this small but welcoming taco joint. Had three tacos (pork special, chicken, and fish) all were quite tasty, and a shrimp and grits appetizer that was tasty and cheesy with just the right amount of spice and crunch from the chicherons. Good selection of local and imported beers and the key lime pie was a nice finishing touch. Will definitely be back.",real
"Even without a Groupon I would visit Cajun Queen! The food is a taste of New Orleans, right here in the Queen City. The ambiance of this restaurant reminds me of the charm of the French Quarter.  A live jazz band plays during the week and adds that perfect touch to a wonderful dining experience. I always say I'm going to try something different, but I usually order ""Three Way Diane"": chicken breast, shrimp and crawfish sauteed with mushrooms, garlic, green, onions, and parsley served over a bed of rice. This dish has a hint of spice to complement the dish. The portion is perfect and depending on my mood, I have some to bring home or I eat every morsel.  Other visits to CQ, I've ordered the BBQ shrimp, shrimp etouffee and the fish of the day. I've just never written a review. The gumbo is good, but on my last visit I felt that it was missing something...just couldn't put my taste buds on it.",real
This place is awesome! I tried the Chicken Chimichanga and I saw the reduction of four people but it was perfect to take a date.,fake
"Awesome ""farm"" food but not your typical Auntie May fare.  This is as good as breakfast gets...just be warned, you will spend a pretty penny on it.  As long as the quality reflects the price tag I'll pay it lol!  I strongly recommend the Bloody Marys.",real
This was a really fun atmospheric Resturant.. its loud and the people are having a good breakfast along with good bloody Mary's and mimosas!We will definitely be back!,real
The bartenders are sweet and helpful. It is a quaint little spot. Come early or you would get the food your sweet and satisfies. The owner and other food is great and nothing much freshed. Reasonable prices and service is great.,fake
My friends and I got the walk in to the lake... the pizza was great!  Nice decor and very good environment.  Everything came out quickly and was delicious.  The drinks were pretty awesome also! especially the Chicago style pizza.,fake
Love this place. Always a treat to check out in a while. It's a lower than the food and decor it's a little right at the rest. They make the right tempura to take home. This is a great restaurant for a special occasion. Always great service.,fake

Amazing food! The Crack street paperment is a must try when in town.,fake
"Never have I ever enjoyed eating at a bar as much as I have here at Spoon. This is why I'm giving Spoon that extra star for a full five because if you can deliver such polished, respectful, elegant service without a reservation and seated at a bar, you have really upped your game and deserve it!We started with the leek flan which reminded me of a delicate, crustless quiche and my husband had the burger (we learned our lesson, if a burger is on the menu at a fancy place, freaking get it!) and I had the pork roast. Of course, these have way fancier names on the menu, but just roll with me here :) We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and experience and I know that you will too, but I have one final shout out for their ""Responsible Citizen"" drink. They create a unique, seasonal mocktail that is on their drink menu. And for sober folks, being able to get something nice to drink that's not just a soda is just really super awesome :)",real
"We came here for Saturday and Sunday brunch! The food was great, really liked eggs Benedict with salmon! The omelet was great as well! Service was fast and the host was very welcoming! Overall very good experience!",real
Great kitchen. The fried rice and calamari was perfect. The curly fries were yummy too.,fake
"This is a top notch steakhouse. Not a cheapie steakhouse like some. But it is definitely worth the little extra cost. Steaks are cooked the way you like and there are several choices. If you don't want steak there are other great choices also. The biscuits are served with honey butter and delicious. They serve you a small relish tray that is part of their long tradition.The desserts are excellent and big enough to split for 2.This place has been here a long time and I have visited a few times over the years. It started as a restaurant next to the Phoenix stockyards of years past. The cows are all gone and now a small business park. But the food is still excellent. Great place for family, small groups or couples night out. Come casual or formal either way the Western styled staff will make you enjoy your meal.",real
Juicy burgers and yummy shakes! Probably the best customer service experience I've had in a while. Our food was taking longer than others to come out and our waitress apologized excessively and then the manager takes a percentage off our bill. That's how it's done if you want customers to return.  Try the butterscotch milkshake.,real
"My son and I made a trip to this restaurant in mid-May 2014 and we were not disappointed.The restaurant is very new (opened Sept. 2013) and clean. Simple decor. When you walk in to the restaurant you are greeted enthusiastically.You can see the chefs and cooks preparing your food through a large, open window. I discovered three people that work there (one is a co-owner) are Hawai'i transplants. My son ate the pork tonkatsu and shrimp katsu combo and I ate the pork tonkatsu curry and rice. Delicious. You grind sesame seeds and mix it with the slightly spicy tonkatsu sauce. This sauce mix sets this restaurant apart from the rest. My son tried the melon float which was very yummy.Price is a little more than the average ""plate lunch"". My dish was $13 and I believe my son's was $16-$17. Spend a few more dollars eating there instead of in the slot machine!I am definitely a fan and will make many more trips there. I hope more Vegas locals and Hawai'i ppl give this place a try.One more plus, their music playing is Kalapana, C&K, IZ....enough said!Best of luck to this new restaurant!",real
"Exceptional sushi quality and variety. Excellent service and great atmosphere. I would highly recommend...in fact, if I wasn't so full, I would want to go right back!",real

Nom! The Oysters Royale and Bouillabaisse are delicious! The original Oyster Bar at Palace Station gets easily packed so this was a good location for a group of 6 to get their oysters on :0),real
Best Mexican food period. I've been eating here multiple times a week for 15 years. Never bad food never a problem. Never even had them mess up an order. They always have it right. Carne Asada tacos with guacamole and tamales or chicken chimi enchilada style with green sauce are my favorites. -Kevin,real
Great food. Great service. Had the Big Bone Steak and it was awesome. The owner came out and sweet. Our waitress was very consistent. Food was great. Service and food was amazing. Service was impeccable and we all ordered the beef on the spice and it was pretty amazing!! Great value too! The guys working there were very nice and attentive. The salads we heard the meat was great and so was the ten steak. It was cooked to perfection and the sides were amazing! It was also great to see a second order in the picture of the build your own.  Kids loved the patty melt and corn salsa.  You get a good amount of food for two cymings for good quality.  I would definitely go back next time I visit Vegas.  It's worth the wait.,fake

"As a southerner, finding good BBQ is something we take seriously. Rollin Smoke did not disappoint. It's off the strip so we took a short Lyft trip over and it was well worth it. I had the two meat platter with pulled pork, sliced brisket and corn nuggets. Both meats were delicious - the brisket was cooked perfectly. The corn nuggets were also great. If you haven't had  them before - try them!",real
"The food is so good! They have a secret menu. I like the ""Balls 2.0.""They consist of risotto, cheese, spinach, and corn deep fried. So crazy, but them some tasty balls! Something for everyone. Super trendy, huge menu, and friendly staff.",real
Delicious food and the service was excellent.  Highly recommend.,fake
"They have improved sooo much over the past year. Food is great. You can see them constantly grilling your chicken and beef. The cilantro lime rice is delicious. I love the fact that, unlike their competitors, they don't charge you extra for toppings such cheese sauce, guac, sour cream, fajita veggies, or salsa. (fuzzy's and cafe Rio charge extra for everything). They have the best chips and queso. If placed against Chipotle, Fuzzy's, Cafe Rio and Moe's, QDOBA WINS BY A MILE!",real
"I used to work here so my opinion is swayed.  The food here is top quality and good priced. I loved working here and I miss the pizza. I couldn't pick just one good thing there. I really do like it all... serious. But If I had to pick:my fav app is the Guca Tonyfav pasta is the Big Rig, but... the Alfredo is close toofav pizza..... ugh.. I like them all, all styles....fav sandwich is meatballfav salad is the pabloI could go on but its Saturday night and I need to go out.",real
"Ok they've really improved in just a couple months as far as friendliness and I'm kinda addicted to their mac and cheese now. Cons, prices are still really high for lots of items and what you get, and they haven't fully transitioned to Panera. Their to-go bags all advertise being able to order online through Panera but their site doesn't recognize this location yet. I hope this happens soon because I hate having to explain customized orders over the phone or the wait times when doing so in person. Other than that, their attitude here has shifted a while 180! Food is tasting better and fresher, (Big kudos to Jacob, by far the friendliest most helpful person there, everything he did was with an honest smile) every employee I talked to was telling me that they hoped I have a great rest of the day and it actually felt genuine and not like they are trying to rush you out or saying it because they have to. I left with a smile on my face and in a much better mood because of it. Also I didn't realize that if you register your Panera card you get a month of free drinks, nice perks!",real
I followed the sky lights to Lucky Foo's last Friday.  Turns out it was their opening night and celebration. The food is not only delicious but it is beautiful to look at. ..true food art. They have an AWEsome assortment of sake including some house infused flavors.  We enjoyed everything about this place! The atmosphere is fresh and the staff is warm and welcoming.,real
I love love love this place !!  Great service and tasty food.  A big plus to the delish banana muffins. I always look forward to getting.

"First time ever coming here today and would definitely recommend it! The young man who waited on us was very friendly and helpful giving my husband what the best deal was for what he wanted! The chicken was very moist and fresh, good sized pieces! I had the 4 piece tenders and my husband had the 3 piece meal and I can't say one negative thing as it was all delicious. I went up to the counter to ask for a take home box and to ask the guy who waited on us for his name and to let him know how awesome he was and that we were very impressed. When he told me his name was Ty and I said oh that's my husbands name too, he shook my hand and went right over to where my husband was sitting and shook his hand. To his manager -  you have got an amazing nice and helpful employee and we will definitely be back. Please let Ty know we appreciate how friendly he was and the food was delicious! Thank you",real

"Some of these reviews kill me.  People go to a wing place and order chicken strips, or get some random sauce they didn't like and blame the restaurant.   Now for what to expect:  I never have/will order anything but a chicken wing from this place and I'd recommend you don't go here unless you want a chicken wing.  Also, it is more setup for a smaller lunch/dinner crowd and I imagine they get most of their business from take out orders.  Lastly, they cook the wings to order which take 15 minutes to prepare.  'Nuff said.Now I have 3 reasons I love this place.  First, their wings are cooked to perfection.  They are juicy and cooked just enough to have that perfect crispness one should except from a chicken wing.  I've never had them screw it up the many times I've been there.  Second, their fries are delicious.  They remind me of boardwalk fries which you don't get around here much and they put what I think is a salt/sugar seasoning on them which is excellent.  Last but not least is their sauces.  While oddly bright red their regular hot flavor is well done.  The garlic parm is simple and delicious.  And my favorite and the most unique is lemon pepper.  It is oddly tangy and I can't figure out how they do it.They aren't cheap but I think you get your money's worth.",real
"We had a very nice experience here and I have to wonder why we hadn't been here before? We came in for a relatively early dinner and were immediately seated in an area with a pleasant, efficient, and knowledgeable server. The salad that was served ahead of our entrees was oh so good! YUMMY!!! The meal itself was very good as well. Everyone in our party enjoyed their meal and we will definitely return.",real
The best Thai restaurant ever. Great good and really friendly people. Thank you Drake we will visit again for sure,real

"Nom nom nom! Did not disappoint, mostly. Service and quality! I had the bone in filet with peppercorn- omg amazing! Shellfish platter is small but so tasty. Hubby was let down with the special Chilean sea bass-wasn't seasoned well. The donuts for dessert, wow, so soft and sweet.  Highly recommend this place.",real
"Not much to say about this place that hasn't been said already from the looks of the hundreds of reviews.  I've tried all of their pizzas except the Marinara and Rosa.  All have been excellent, but wasn't such a fan of the Wiseguy.  Too much onion for me, but the fennel sausage is great.  The Biancoverde and the margherita with fennel sausage are my favorites.  Next time I'll be trying the Rosa for sure.Some tips:  So of course you hear about the crazy long waits.  Make the most of your time if you have a three hour wait.  Go check out the Science Center's Body Worlds while you wait.  I think it's about $20 to get in, but it really is cool and kills a couple hours.  Then make your way back to Bar Bianco.  Get a bottle of wine and one of their appetizers (cheese dish is good, but small).  By the time you finish the bottle it's time to eat.  Also, I highly recommend going in the fall or spring on a really nice night so you can sit outside with your wine.  Enjoy!",real

"Finding MacAlpine's is fairly simple as it's located on the corner of 7th and E. Oak. There's a small parking lot on the side of the building off of Oak st. When you first walk in you might think to yourself, ""Whoa, this place serves food?"" And yes, my friend they certainly do. Once you get passed the trinkets and other items you'll find an original old fashioned soda bar, several booths, and dining tables. The decor is a cluttered arrangement of vintage 1920's and 30's memorabilia.The staff was very friendly and helpful with answering my questions about the many creative ice cream soda creations available. They use hand scooped ice cream and flavored sodas created the same way it was in the late 1920's. I have to admit it made for one of the, if not the best, ice cream sodas I've ever had. Yes, it was really that good. For my menu choice I opted for the chef's special that day which happened to be a meatloaf sandwich. Served on toasted wheat bread, with fresh tomato, lettuce and a slight bit of mayo. The meatloaf itself was packed full of flavor. Although a little softer in texture than I usually prefer, I couldn't stop eating until my plate was clean. Even though I ordered a side of coleslaw and got potato salad instead. I was truly not disappointed. The potato salad was to die for. I wish I could order more and have it shipped home. If you've made it this far in my review, give yourself a treat and head to MacAlpines. There's a 10 lb sundae called 'The Legend' waiting for your challenge.",real
This is probably one of my favorite breakfast joints in Las Vegas. The staff is amazing and the food is great! Try their coffee...it's the best coffee in town :),real
This was our first time here and service was great. The food was amazing and the service was great. We will absolutely be back.,fake
I think it's the best hot pot in this area. Love the hot soup base and lamb/ beef rolls here! Watermelon juice was yummy,real
Great food! Great service! I like the burgers and the costumer services here. They have perfect breakfast but most of the types of food seems to be honest and delicious. This is a great place to come for lunch or a long time.,fake
I love this place. I always order the beef tacos and sticky toffee pudding. It's absolutely fabulous!!!!!!,fake
"I'm from South Texas where Mexican food flows like rivers of milk and honey. Been living in AZ a couple of years and have been on a mission to find the ultimate taste of Mexican food from home.  Boy, oh boy. My husband took me here one afternoon.  I ordered a green chile burrito. Let's just say that my husband kept talking and I had to tell him to stop talking to me because my food was so flavorful that I didn't want to waste my energy talking but instead focusing on the party of perfect blend of spices, juicy succulent gravy, warm fresh flour tortilla and the earthy flavor of green chiles going on in my mouth!  Amazing!    Yes. Yes. Yes. A definite treasure this place is.",real
"I mean it's WINGSTOP! I prefer them over all wing places here in the valley and I've tried a handful of them. The wings are never too greasy, the fries are delish especially when paired with their honey mustard sauce. The only thing is the wait. Yes I'm a bit impatient but knowing that they come up fresh does make up for it and now that I can pre-order online, even better.",real
"Great!! Food is very good. They have very friendly and helpful staff. I suggest the more items on the menu and the black tea customer service is excellent. The burgers are great, too. The lines move fast and its clean.",fake
This place is awwsome! So spicy! Margaritas are bomb an service is so fast! Highly recommend,real
"Probably the best sushi I've had in the area. The staff was very attentive, great atmosphere and the food was to die for! (First class pizza I've tried).  Classic Saturday morning!",fake
"A great find! They have a variety of soups, the waiters are super friendly and helpful! Love this place !",fake
"Place is the bomb.com! I thought the food at Graze was mediocre until I went in for Asian night on Thursday. We ordered shrimp toast, sushi, and green curry and all three were seriously DELICIOUS. They were by far the best meals we've had there. I wish they'd change the whole menu to Asian style because it's clearly chef's specialty. I'm sitting here drooling just thinking about it. Mmm!...Grab you a cocktail with it too - best bartender in the world, Ramon, will keep you topped off. In fact, everyone on staff takes care of you like you're family - But minus that ""help yourself"" bullshit. They won't have you lifting a finger, especially Ken, he's great!The atmosphere is lively and totally not like the other lame af country clubs. Most of the members are friendly and fun. There are events going on all the time like trivia night, golf stuff, tennis stuff, you name it. My mom made a whole gang of friends here! Don't worry it's not a tough gang though. They're into water aerobics and earth wind & fire.",real

"I have been to Jacobs a few times but recently fall 2012.SEE:  The ambience was positive. Quiet enough to hear yourself think and carry a conversation but not painstakingly so. It was fairly crowded. Upscale but simplistic decor. Very poised. The type of people  I saw varied. Old, young, casual dressed, formally dressed . The common characteristic = a very large dispensable income.EXEPERIENCED:  I had made reso's for around 10 I believe, but due to the weather I got there after my date, and it was 11:00 p.m. They never mentioned a word about it and sat me as if I was there on time, and served just as well. Their kitchen closes at 11:00 pm., but there was not even an inkling of annoyance. That is enough to endorse the 5 star rating. My date had a steak, which he said was good but went to Jacob's months later (recently) and said it was even  more amazing - this could be attributed to the late arrival. The service was amazing, you would have no less than 3, 4 people waiting on you in general and making sure you were okay, but one main server. Servers were always attentive, but knew when to let us be alone. Food came promptly. TASTE:  I ordered the lobster salad. It was extremely good. I had a glass of Riesling as well. Duck fat frites were very good. Everything on point in regards to the food.FELT:  Food was amazing, service impeccable. FUTURE:  Would return to celebrate something special. And force whomever my date was to purchase the thousand dollar steak. NOTE:   As let on in the above aforementioned category, this place is expensive, but you would understand why. The salad was about $25.00, the fries were probably $15.00..steak median price is about $60.00 so you get the idea. . It is a truly beautiful restaurant and the service is great.",real
"I can't believe Dave S. and I went to the same location! I received really great customer service. I had never been there before and the man at the counter was just over the top nice. I got a chicken salad sandwich that was delicious (although I will get it on wheat bread next time and not the croissant, it was really just croissant-shaped white bread) and that day they were giving out free iced teas. They also have a punch card, if you buy 5 sandwiches you get a free one (and you get two punches on Tuesdays). Will definitely be back!",real
What a BIG EGGROLL!!! I can't believe I ate... the... whole... thing! Eddie was awesome serving up his menu knowledge and cold bubbly on a hot July day. Will definitely be back for more.,real

Oh my goodness this was so good!! Haven't had Cuban food like that since I visited Fort Lauderdale. I got the Lechon Asado and my friend got the Cuban sandwich. Both were excellent choices. The pork was well seasoned and very flavorful. And it was even better the second day for leftovers. And I loved the staff so make sure to say hi to them too.,real
"Everything I've ever gotten here has been delicious, including the old breakfast standards.  Great staff, friendly and personable.",real
Amazing food! I got to try German potato salad for the first time and it was very good! A little pricey maybe but the large portions make up for that and then some! We'll be visiting again for sure!,real
We love the new Mission at Kierland.  We have always been fans of the original Mission in Old Town.  The new restaurant is very well done.  We came in for dinner on the 9th day it was open.  There was a good crowd and we let our waiter Pete know that we were in a slight hurry.  The drinks and food were amazing and the service from Pete was top notch.  Overall a great dinner spot and highly recommend!!,real
One of the best dinners I have ever had ..... and I eat a lot (too many) nice dinners.  Great service and ambiance which only makes the food taste even better.I dare you to try but dont clog up my reservation time ;),real
Delicious! I had the chicken avocado sandwich which is consistently good and fresh.  Great place to do it.,fake
Probably the best chicken sandwich I have ever had in the valley. Don't let the outside fool you I will be back again. Delicious sandwiches and salads. Definitely a must try if you are running a review.,fake
"Their pizzas are amazing! They use fresh ingredients and so many choices. Service is fast and polite, within the cancen menu that is always full. Follow the show at the bar and spend a month now.  I would go back all the time and we had a wonderful time and we were all super surprised. I would suggest a new jersey type of fish plate with so much to choose from.  The sour cream cooked to perfection, and tasty fried okra. Definitely recommend this place!",fake
AMAZING food!!! I have tried most of the valley and this place has become a favorite of mine.  We are so happy to see real thai food.,fake
"I spent the day training here and Hector's dedication to his students is second to none. He gives 100% focus towards the students and thats a rare find in Las Vegas, if you want to be good at the sport. Cobrinha techniques are taught at the highest level. This is a great place to train for all ages, don't hesitate to join.",real
"My client took me here for lunch. We had a combo plate for appetizer, it came with a cheese dip and an assortment of Italian favourites, much too big for two people but I am not complaining. The main was a seafood pasta one of the best. Flavourful sauce with large fresh seafood. The portion was dinner size, and I finished half, a complete credit to how good it was. Actually had to undo my pants button. The restaurant was packed with weekday lunch crowds, mostly office workers nearby. The staff handled the rush effortlessly. This restaurant is quite far from downtown but I dare say that the locals know what is best and by my personal experience and the fact that it is always packed, it is worth coming all this way....",real
"Just tried this place for the first time. The food was fantastic. The portions are huge, and the service was excellent. Plus, the price was right- highly recommended.The patio is nice too.",fake
"This was our first trip to Smallman Galley and we will certainly be returning. This evening we tried Iron Born   Chef Pete's pizza concept should take every single Pittsburgher out of their stereo typical local pizza joint habits into an amazingly delightful crispy, airy heaven. The white pizza was absolutely fantastic.  Garlic Cream - Caramelized Onions, Marinated Cherry Tomatoes, Arugula, Whipped Ricotta were so perfectly matched with this unbelievable crust. The garlic chili wings are large and packed the perfect amount of heat. We had the unique opportunity to sit at the high top counter facing the other restaurants.  Directly next to one of the cooks from another restaurant in the Galley.  His excitement talking about his chef at BRUNOISE made us excited to return and try Chef Ryan's creations. We enjoyed our meal, chatting with the cooks and people watching. The bar sever fantastic beer selections in addition to drink choices that compliment the menus of the restaurants. I highly recommend a visit to Smallman Galley.  They are open early on the weekends and I hear they each have an amazing brunch menu.",real

First time there and the wife and I enjoyed the food and service as well.,fake
Fantastic food and great service. Had a great lunch here with my wife and I. A lot of it but way across from the bay who make the best crab ramen I've ever had. The portions are huge also....and not fish so obsessed with the chicken pad Thai and panno flat.   They also have a latte and the blended pastrami combo.  This place is pretty close and the service is first rate.  You can't beat that summer party.,fake
This place is really good! I tried the margarita pizza with pork. Friendly staff. Most amazing coffee I've had in a very long time. Upscale and quick delivery time - good and cheap. Definitely a hidden gem!,fake
Had a great meal at the bar.  We thought the food was very good.  I liked the fresh brewed ice cream and the music was great!,fake
Excellent. I agree with the other reviewers; Best BBQ in the East Valley. I've tried them all and this place is legit.  I had a Brisket plate. The meat was well smoked and I didn't feel the need to drench it in sauce.  Selection of sauces was real good.  My favorite is the Sassy sauce. Will definitely be back soon.,real
"Favorite place to eat pizza in town. Love the taramotas, spaghetti and meatballs! Always fresh and has a nice selection of wines.",fake
Had the jerk chicken burrito with potatoes. It was amazing as well. I will definitely be going back.,fake
"This place never disappoints and consistently offers a wide variety of only the best ingredients and toppings. If you seek organic Italian tomato sauce, meats raised without use of antibiotics, or even halal/gluten free options, highly recommend Panago to satisfy your pizza cravings.Also, loving the #sharemorecanada summer pizza boxes designed by Toronto born illustrator @chairman_ting to celebrate #canada150 !For more food related posts and restaurant discoveries, check out my Insta: @tacobelle._",real
"Hot Bread served with Pesto is a new thing for them since I was there last year.  I'm actually from Chicago.  The great food and excellent customer service is why I keep going back.I love their calamari, best I've had yet.  We had steak which is pricey but was excellent!They don't have rootbeer and I am still sad after all these years.  But this year they had me try some ice teas which I didn't like at all.  After a few different trial drinks the waiter surprised me with root beer that he got from another restaurant just for me!Blake made our night and we had a wonderful time celebrating my friend's birthday!",real
The best pho ever!Live in LA and visiting Phoenix. We need soup noodle so came here to get pho. Soup is rich and very delicious! Me and my friend are happy for this place!!,real

Amazing. Will definitely be going back soon. The fried chicken is awesome!,fake
"I love this freakin place.  Maybe because I was raised in the southwest and have been living on the East Coast for the past 2 years, but now that I'm in Vegas for a conference.  I saw this place on Groupon and went for it.  Turned out to be the best decision I've ever made.  The carne asada is majestic.  I had the Super Burrito, stuffed with pollo and carne asada, and to my surprise, it is topped with sauce and guac.  it doesn't get much better than that!",real
"One of the first all you can eat kbbq places in Arizona.  The meat is bomb, the service is bomb, the atmosphere is bomb. It was so clean and modern compared to the usual greasy and messy kbbq places in LA. Not only is the service really good, but also the meat is really something special. The marinades are so sweet and complement the meat pretty well. For all you can eat, the quality is actually really good. I recommend the chadol (/Brisket), Korean Fried Chicken, and all the marinated pork belly. Only $16 for lunch menu but you still get way more that you won't even be able to try everything.Another unique aspect about Gen is that the smoke from the grills is vacuumed underneath the table, so none of that greasy meat smell on your clothes. They change your grills really often and check up on you to refill your meats pretty fast. I'm so glad we finally have all you can eat kbbq in AZ. As a college student, this place is godsend.",real

(It all sounded so good!!)The food came out and the server was pleasant, the presentation was amazing and the taste was fabulous!!

"So I love this Krispy Kreme.  I always get great customer service here.  They always have smiles on their faces and are ready to help you out no matter how busy they are.  Even late at night, they are very friendly and accommodating.  I think it is really important to instantly greet customers with a smile on your face for the customers to see.  It makes the whole experience a pleasant one and you leave with your doughnuts happy.  I always get the glazed, they are delicious, and they always give me fresh warm ones.  I have yet to try their other flavored doughnuts, but the lady recommended the Oreo filled doughnut which was one of her favorites.  They were very patient with me and nice to me while they were waiting for me to choose whether I wanted to get glazed or a different kind of doughnut, which I really liked because I don't like being rushed into make a decision especially when it comes to food. They even gave me a free doughnut for buying a dozen. I will always be coming here from now on! This is pretty much the only Krispy Kreme location I know of in the South West side and I am happy the staff are awesome too!  I give them an A++ for their customer service, cleanliness, and efficiency.",real

"Wow!! This place is awesome! Appetizer was the best pommes frites I've had. I had a standard burger which was delicious. Try the garlic mayo, it's yummy. My boyfriend had the meet your maker burger and lived it. Even the chips served with the burger are wonderful. We split a Carmel pretzel milkshake and it was out of this world! Don't miss this place. A little expensive but sooo worth it!",real
Amazing. Go here. EVERYTHING on the menu is super delicious. I got the scallops! And wow! I wiped my plate clean. We also had the oysters to start wow. Ridiculous how low expectations I had then BOOM! Flavour explosion one dish after the other!,real

Delicious and surprisingly good food to say. I'm getting hungry or date.,fake

"First visit! I arrived at 12:15 and the line was so long, but I really wanted to try it and I was already there so I stuck it out. Thankfully, the line moves pretty fast! They make your order in waves: first the crust (reg or gluten-free), cheese and sauce, meats, and then vegetables and herbs. It went quickly and it only needs a few minutes in the oven to bake. I got tomato sauce, mozzarella, and red onions, mushrooms, olives, tomatoes, jalapeños, artichokes and spinach. I do wish it was fresh spinach instead of cooked. It was delicious! Thin, crispy crust and the rest was soft. I'm excited for my leftovers. The salads looked really good and they even have a pookie (pizza cookie) dessert. Yum!",real

Ill be back, they are always friendly.",real
"We ate here twice and both times the food was outstanding. The Kung Pao Hen is amazing, and so are the green chile grits. The short rib hash is inspired. Whoever is running the kitchen is talented. Love the well-restored mid century decor. The service is friendly, eager, and a little amateurish (forgot to bring my husband new utensils, cleared a cocktail glass before I had finished it). Nothing unforgivable, but maybe a little more training is in order.",real
Tammy and the beef was amazing. Friendly staff and incredible dining experience. I would recommend this place to anyone,fake

Great food. I have been going to this location since they opened. I enjoy the community table in the bar area.  I don't have to wait for a table.  They truly have great wine always.  I order different stuff sometimes and shocked of the wine selection.  Many restaurants it's tough to find really great wines by the glass.  Houston's always does this and food great.,real
This place is awesome. The fish tacos and moscow mules were wonderful. Service was fast and friendly. The sushi was also very good. Try the pan fried lamb and it was delicious!,fake

(It's true..they really are.)Being that I work in the mall, it's my go-to spot for a Diet Coke or a little 3pm pick-me-up. Free refills too, which is a nice little perk. They've always got a line (especially Fri-Sun), so make sure you know what to order by the time you get to the register. I highly recommend the Tomato Basil pasta salad, the black & white Chippers, the Chicken Walnut salad and the peach decaf iced tea!The manager, Jessie, is also a doll. Very nice.",real

Very attentive but not overbearing. My husband ordered the ribs and I stole a bite. They were very tender and moist. The sauce was sweeter than we expected but tasty. I ordered the Rogue Burger. I could only finish half. The aioli was spicier than I thought it would be but the fresh avocado cooled it down. Overall. We had a wonderful time and left in a wheelbarrow.  ;)",real

It won't be much longer before they are hiring Front of the House staff to man the tables! The food is good, The staff is nice. I like that they are getting their name out there and a local business being successful. On this trip I had the chicken, which is always good in flavor and spare rib, in the duo smokin plate. The spare rib was tender and tasty. I got the jalapeno coleslaw...it's so good! The BF got the Brisket Dog, omg! If I wasn't eating right, I'd devour that whole thing without a second thought! It was so good, anything with nacho cheese is good! The BF got the potato salad, which was basic but the bacon of course added a yummy touch! We love this place!

The variety is unreal, and everything is tended to so there are no steam pans with one withering shrimp. Everyone must try this once. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",real

This Place is not the best as far as paradise. It is a special place for the future & my husbands birthday Mother we got shirt and toasted cauliflower and the gangnam cookie. The atmosphere was super clean and the food was amazing!,fake
"Warm and easy to found in the area! I ordered a few of the sauces and salad and to top it off, the Enly go weer on the way to start to you !",fake
This is the best buffet in Vegas. Eat here at least once a week and I'm never disappointed.,fake
Really cool little place that might be easily overlooked. The service was excellent and I never felt rushed at all.  I had the lobster poutine and the churros for dessert. Both were fantastic.,real
"We stopped in to Bad Daddy's for dinner the other night while driving through Charlotte to get a quick bite to eat. There was a wait for tables so we sat at the bar. The bar tender, Brett was really friendly and helpful. He gave us an explanation of the menu and shared what some of his favorites are. The menu can definitely be intimidating since there are so many options, but boy, what fun!  You can select one of their 'pre-defined' burgers, or  build any burger that you want.  You have the choice of beef, chicken, turkey,buffalo,  black bean or even ahi tuna for your burger, and many topping, condiment and cheese selections.The salads work the same way, you choose your lettuce and then choose the vegetables, cheese, proteins, toppings and dressing that you would like. The DH and I decided to split a salad and a burger. We added the jalapeno bacon at Brett's recommendation to our burger and boy was that bacon good! It added a nice spice and flavor without being too hot. The burger was cooked perfectly, it was pink, juicy and delicious!  We got the tots for a side and they were served with a nice tasy dipping sauce. I was commenting to my DH that the balsamic vinaigrette was too sweet and Brett heard me and immediately turned around and asked if I'd like some straight balsamic vinegar to tone it done. That was just what it needed and I was really impressed with that level of service. Even though this is a chain, they seem to work hard to make you feel like it's your neighborhood burger joint. I'm very excited that we have one in Raleigh now and can't wait to try it out!",real
"My Sister, Brother in Law, and little niece came into town and what better way to celebrate then some French Gourmet food by Chef Thomas Keller. We went to Bouchon (http://www.bouchonbistro.com/) at the Venetian. I walk by it a few times a week and it smells soooooo good so I figure it would be a fabulous place to dine at. Boy I was right! The wait staff was super friendly and spot on. Top notch service and great tasting food cant go wrong.My brother in law and I ordered the same thing. ""Steak Frites"" - Pan seared prime flatiron served with maitre d'hotel butter and French fries. Great minds and hungry stomachs think alike. The steak was cooked to perfection and the herb butter on top enhances the flavor. Of course the fries were crispy and delicious.My date ordered the ""Plat de Cotes de Porc"" - slow cooked (72 hours) pork short ribs with red wine braised cabbage and creamy yellow corn polenta.My sister ordered the ""Maules au Safran et a la Moutarde"" - Maine Bouchot mussels steamed in white wine, mustard and saffron, served with French fries.For dessert, we had the special ""Bouchons"" - Brownie cakes with 3 types of ice cream. We also tried the Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee. Both were excellent.",real
Very friendly staff. Great fresh food made when you order it.  This place is Not like the other Mexican food places. Unique.  Great chimi.  Will be back.,real
Good authentic Indian food. I especially enjoyed the curry chicken and dessert balls. They also had great tea. I am not accustomed to Indian foods but I enjoyed what I had. Great place for vegan dining.,real

Best Greek food in town.  The gyro is fantastical.  The gyro player is great for sharing.  I have been 100's of times over the years and have never had a complaint.  It's amazing they are still open as the location is horrific.  Once Nelson's custard closed next door I thought for sure they would be next.  I have told them they need to open up in the mall or in a casino location.  The food is way to good to see them fail.  Especially with places like mad Greek and that place at the mall Kylos Greek cafe (horrible).  If you want a family friendly great Greek food give them a try you won't be disappointed.  Oh Greek fry's are awesome.,real
"The Bomb.com I was so surprised that they sucked me in an italian food and they made me so much fun! Thank you for a good time, really great food and quick service. I had the sliders ( my significand one) and I noticed a lot of Greek cuisine but it was a really good burger, I had the veggie roll, and the seafood pasta with white sauce. It was great. Me and the husband went to eat here 3 weeks ago. The food was amazing and the staff was on top of their guenders.  We will be back!!!",fake
I have been to other Mexican places but it's so good! Tried the steak sandwich and a breakfast burrito and it was amazing! Great place!,fake

My husband I love this place for a few reasons. 1-they deliver! 2-original philly cheese steak sandwich! We also love their wings! We usually get delivery but we've eaten inside a few times too. Haven't had anything I didn't like so far (knock on wood),real
Delicious and great service with Chang!! We had the moo woo combo and not disappointed.  Highly recommend this place,real
"Excellent brunch! We aren't one for fighting the buffet lines or stuffing our faces first thing in the morning so this place was perfect. This restaurant has a great modern French vibe and very flavorful food. We started out with the ""best butter in the world"" for an extra $5 and it was worth it. The butter was that classic French butter with a side of rock salt. It wasn't hard and easy to spread on the cut bread that was served with the butter. The tables that did not upgrade the butter had small French baguettes that also looked good but our bread was amazing. Perfect spongy texture on the inside with a crunchy crust on the outside. Definitely worth the upgrade if you like bread and butter. I wanted to be a little healthy before overindulging the rest of the day so I tried a side salad to start. Amazing. It had a light citrus vinegarette and very fresh lettuce. The lettuce tasted like butter lettuce but had more color to it. Simple salad but packed with flavor. I ordered the steak and eggs for my main. Not the most flavorful but cooked exactly medium rare like I asked for. I didn't see my steak knife and ended up using a butter knife the whole time and had no issues cutting it. Eggs were pretty standard but did look like European eggs because the yolk was more orange. As sides we got the thick cut bacon. Super thick cut and it was delicious. No burnt taste to it and so flavorful. We would definitely order this side again. Overall, great experience. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Lots of flavor in all the food. Typical French menu with a few twists and extras to cater to Americans. Great decor. We will definitely be going back for brunch.",real
First stop on our Vegas weekend and  our server Jovanny rocked it! Must stop for Daddy's Margarita and Nachos!,real

Do your belly your party you found the specialty dishes.  The customer service is wonderful.  She recommended me the chicken and steak sandwich and they were all open",fake
"The best burger place around..........of course I know good mushroom and mussels n sour cream. I am sure we live in NY. Great little gem, best sushi in town. Many vegan burgers are good too. Love the breads and poutine. For a penny then anymore because I heard the drinks are not just the other items on the menu. Delicious and fun tea/set up. The service was great and food was good. I went here on a weekday evening and had to go far to the Stratosphere with amazing cocktails!  We had the lamb chops.  Found them on Yelp and was pleasantly surprised at the ambiance. Service was good and the food was amazing. The service was perfect. Highly recommend.",fake

"What can I say that 2800 people haven't already said in their reviews? Christy G. and I always try to dine at Mon Ami Gabi when we're in Vegas, and every visit has been spectacular. For one, the service is always impeccable. The location can't be beat, with an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains and truly top notch people watching. I particularly like watching the drunk bambi-legged girls (""weenie wobbles"") trying not to fall in their too-high heels :) Or even worse, the ones holding their heels and walking down Las Vegas Blvd in their blackened bare feet *shudder*The Onion Soup au Gratin ($9.95) is a definite must-have. The broth is rich and savory, packed with perfectly soaked baguette slices and caramelized onions, and topped with about a pound of melted gruyere. I crave this soup even when it's triple digits outside; it's that good. Another staple is the Filet Mignon Merlot ($34.95), which comes with a merlot infused butter and a red wine reduction. The filet (medium rare for me) is always perfectly cooked and melts in your mouth. I don't personally care for the frites that everyone raves about, but they've always been super accommodating about switching it out for another side at a small upcharge. I've had the pommes puree, garlic spinach, sauteed mushrooms, and the macaroni au gratin - all amazing. I'm always way too stuffed for dessert, so I won't comment on those. They also have a pretty substantial wine list, and about two dozen wines by the glass. And if you stop by for brunch, the build your own Bloody Mary cart is a godsend! Bottom line: don't miss out; this place is amazing! Ask for a table on the patio and come hungry!",real
"This is my favorite local bar to hang out, grab a brew, and hang with friends. The bartenders are friendly, funny and always at your service. The mac and cheese is a great pick from the menu if you are in the market for some munch. Another lesser known but interesting and useful thing to know about Smokin' Joe's is the room upstairs available to rent for functions. There's a bar and plenty of seating, a great find for a birthday party or other special occasion.The beer selection on tap is great, but they have an even bigger cooler with cans and bottles with a wide variety of choices. Check this place out, it's a winner!",real
Very nice place with great customer service! Took my fiancee for a stress just to stumble into and we are always friendly from the staff they have. Best eats in town. Their rolls are complementary as well. Highly recommend.,fake

Right across from the BNV so it's convenient too!I love that there were other options for a side besides French fries - I got the broccoli with cheese sauce.",real

Their portions are big and you could have the same great reviews and was not disappointed.  Nothing fancy just great food at a great price.  I highly recommend this place if you want to eat at the bar they also have a great burger with a Wed and they serve ur fried chicken and some Garlic fries. Food made to perfection and service was awesome. Definitely recommend!",fake
"I am so happy to have found Tabletop! For $5 (only five dollars!! for as long as you want to play! I can't believe people think this is expensive!), you get unlimited access to nearly 1000 games, ranging from childhood games (remember Don't Break the Ice?) to complicated strategy games (like Settlers of Catan). The service is good, the desserts are delicious (I've never had any of the food though, so I can't speak to that). Anytime we have questions or want to learn a new game, Joshua is there with an idea and an encyclopedic knowledge of the rules. Considering how expensive board games are, a place like this is a treasure! They do get busy on weekend nights, so go early, call ahead, or be willing to wait a bit at a nearby bar. It's worth it!",real

"In the high end, Yorkville, restaurant environment you need to be creative to stand out and Figures definitely does this. When you first walk in the door, it looks like a small little hobby shop with a cool collage mural and it's not until the hostess presses a button to open a hidden door to reveal the rest of the restaurant. From that point on, you keep discovering new things, from the imaginative artwork on the walls to the Pacman inspired ceiling lighting and more. You almost want to walk around and take in every piece as if it's a museum (but I don't think the other diners would appreciate this so much!)The cocktail menu was divided into traditional and modern cocktails and I was able to try a few. As people have mentioned, this place is clearly not a place you go for cheap eats and drinks but the cocktails were boozy, well-balanced, and included a lot of premium and interesting ingredients I like to see in a cocktail menu. I would actually say they were great value for the price.The dinner menu is ""small plates"" style and so our waitress suggested we order a few. I loved the beet dish and tried the Kobe steak as well because if you're going to go all out for fine dining, you might as well, right? It was everything people say kobe beef is; I could cut into it like butter and the flavours were amazing!I should note I was also very impressed with the service throughout my experience. The way the bussing team quickly and discretely attacked the table to clear items, crumb the table, and reset fresh cutlery for every course was truly impressive as someone who works in this industry!All in all, I truly enjoyed my experience! The price point means that not everyone is able to enjoy it every day but if you're planning a special occasion or want to treat yourself, Figures is certainly one of the most inventive new restaurants in the city to do this!",real

Everything was delicious, as usual. We started with the Raclette, which includes a variety of pickled vegetables and is always delicious. My husband ordered the New York Strip steak, I ordered the duck confit, and they were both amazing. For dessert, I had the chocolate truffle cake, which is always a great choice. My husband tried the gingerbread, and it was also very tasty. We also both enjoyed an Irish coffee with dessert. I think it was the best one I've ever had.",real

"Every time I go into this location I get a wonderful response. Parking is free and easy there, music isn't loud, the people behind the counter aren't pretentious and are extremely knowledgeable. I value good coffee and they have some of the highest rated beans in AZ. They really showcase the respect of coffee and the passion for it. They are always willing to answer my questions and do so with the confidence of someone who wants to just spread the love and passion. They have a great food menu and is one of the only breakfast places in central phoenix that you don't have to wait in line to eat. They open at 6:30 so you can order your food to go even. It's always super clean and polished. In fact, I've been to other press locations, and they all seem to hold up this standard of respect and responsibility. I want to finalize it by stating that it is more attention detailed and calm and real than your average corporate coffee shop. They don't give you that fake customer service (where you leave the place wondering if they were actually nice or just fake nice) that most corporate places give you. They also don't want you to feel like you'd rather have that fake nice. I don't think they've ever given me small talk and I thank them for that. Press has been one of those real experiences in a city full of fake smiles. Thank guys",real

"I was referred by a co-worker to enjoy dinner here, so while visiting Scottsdale we made reservations to enjoy their chef's menu in the cellar.  We (as two couples) arrived and were promptly greeted by the hostess and then taken to the cellar for our dinner.  We had an amazing table right in the middle of this quaint room, adorned with wine racks (filled with wine) all around us.  The room has exposed rock walls, brick floors and timber framing - truly sets the proper setting for enjoying a great wine-paired chef's menu!Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and helped us makes selections of an extra bottle of wine, as well as going into detail explained each of the many courses of our incredible dinner.Each course was prepared perfectly!  Each bite was full of amazing flavor and the wine pairing matched each course perfectly.  We enjoyed each bite and sip!  Each course was plated so very beautifully!  I could go on and on about each course and how amazing the filet was, but you'll need to experience it for yourself.The restaurant itself is beautiful!  Upstairs are a couple of larger rooms for private groups and they perfectly sized to accommodate most business groups for an amazing dinner.We can't speak highly of Lon's at the Hermosa.... We definitely look forward to returning!",real

"Eating out as a vegetarian/vegan is always difficult, but luckily at places like Grasshopper we plant eaters can order ANYTHING from the menu (and big plus for being able to afford it too)!There's a Grasshopper location on College, pretty close to UofT and Chinatown, but this afternoon we ventured out to the Junction since en route to High Park. Food- 4/5. The menu is very diverse - salads, brown rice bowls, sandwiches and veggie burgers. Some vegan sweet treats are available at the front counter. We ordered the ""chicken"" nuggets (with BBQ sauce - we were recommended this flavor over the peanut sauce!) and turmeric tofu scramble as apps. Tip - the appetizers are pretty small, so don't plan on using them as mains. I loved the tofu scramble even though it was small and really simple - literally just seasoned tofu. The texture was more chewy and less watery and the flavor definitely soaked through. For mains we ordered the Haru salad and the beet burger with a side of sesame fries. The Haru salad was not that great tbh since it had too high of a green leaves:toppings ratio lol. There weren't that many kidney beans or chickpeas (all at the bottom of the bowl). But upsides were that it appeared huge, the dried gobo flakes were interesting and reminded me of much thinner taru chips which I adore, and the plum sauce was a refreshing addition. The beet burger looked really anticlimactic and the patty itself (beet pink!) looked funky but tasted so bland and boring. I did like how the bun was whole wheat and a slice of lotus root came with it. Don't bother ordering the fries - they are just basic McD's thin-cut fries and very ordinary.PS. They do have a small brunch menu here, including ""chicken"" + wafflesValue- 5/5. Spent ~$38 for 2 people and all that food not incl tip. Pretty solid value for sit-down style vegan",real
"I was going through my bookmarks and I realized I never did my review for Echo and Rig. I came here with my husband last month. I advise making a reservation. It was busy. I was told that it would be an hour wait. No problem. It was my fault for not making a reservation; I should have known better! Lol. But anyway I left my name and number with the hostess and went off to do some shopping around Tivoli Village.We were seated in a nice spot of the restaurant. It was a nice set up and there was a little bit of noise from all of the people there but it wasn't so loud to the point where I had to yell to hear my husband.I had looked on Yelp prior to my visit and hoped that I could try the black spaghetti but unfortunately it was not a dish they no longer served. I went for the grass fed lasanga and my husband had a nice cut of the rib eye. For an appetizer we had mussels. Everything was delicious with the perfect portions. We also got the seasonal sorbets. They give you 1 scoop of each flavor. I liked the pink grapefruit the best! Celine was our server. She was detailed in explaining the menu to is and was a lovely person to talk to. When I come again, I will make a reservation and request if I can have her as my server.",real

The calamari was well cooked and I like everything. It was flavorful. The staff was very kind and efficient and offered a great view of the window is a nice venue. We all were pleasantly surprised with the food. I just wish I lived closer because i would recommend it to anyone looking for something similar food.,fake
"Great food, great service. The place is clean and the service is excellent too. The GF is great and always crispy, and the vegetarian options are great for a quick bite on the strip and the staff is super friendly and attentive, and the outside manager usually fast one. The food is the best ever. We ordered the family style and it was pretty good. Definitely worth the wait.",fake
Went to dinner there for the first time and it was excellent.  The service was good and the food was phenomenal.  Garlic Prawns and Carne Asada Werri were amazing!  We got the buffalo chicken pizza and they were excellent. Customer service was great. Thanks for a great experience,fake

Great experience and incredible food.  I had the chicken and leek crepes.  Outstanding!  Great service in a quant setting.  I will definitely be returning to this little gem in downtown Scottsdale soon.,real
"Tried this place for the first time last week. Service was fantastic. The restaurant reminded me of an asian chipotle. The prices are really reasonable for what you get. The food is prepared and cooked on the premises. I loved how fresh and tasty everything was. The sauces were also very delicious. The restaurant had a modern vibe, appeared to be environmentally conscious (recycle bin, biodegradable plates, etc.). It was also incredibly clean inside. Will definitely be going back:)",real
"I was in Pittsburgh over the weekend for a wedding and stayed at the Westin. Bills Bar and Burger is the hotel bar/restaurant. Pros - Service was great. Every employee was attentive and easy going. Vincent the bartender, GO TO HIM! There was a female bartender as well. I can't remember her name, but she was fantastic as well. $2 happy hour drink specials. SERIOUSLY AMAZING! They serve food until midnight I believe. I had an order of fries. Fresh and crispy!Cons - They close too early, but not their choice. After several drinks you can get lost trying to get to the restrooms. That's it. No other complaints from me.",real
"Love it!  The espresso is great and I love that I can get almond milk lattes!  Sometimes they have vegan gluten-free desserts, which is an added bonus.  This place is always crowded, but that is just part of the deal.  Highly recommended!",real

"I'm giving this place a five star for their Tiramisu that is made in-house and their friendly, attentive service from our server, Melissa and her assistant Elliot. I took my Mom here for a late lunch. We were greeted by Elliot when we walked in and asked us if we prefer the booth or high stool chairs. Booth pleeease! And I'm glad we did. I never knew how nice it is in the back of the restaurant. I always came in for dinner and sat in the front area or patio seating. Summer time is great with those booths in the back. Melissa introduced herself and asked if we would like to order any drinks. For two of us, she recommended the large Pellegrino, which was way too much for us. At the end of our meal, I burped and it stung my nose so bad, I had a tear fall down my cheek. Order the small bottle instead. Your nose will thank me later! We ordered a small Grimaldi's House Salad, which looked more like a large portion! It felt like I drank a tall glass of fresh kool-aid. So refreshing! We ordered their large pizza with green peppers, artichoke hearts, and Italian sausage. My mom creation.. don't ask. Elliot came by with our pizza and asked us.. who would like the first slice. Then asked if we would like any Oregano, Parmesan Cheese, Garlic Powder, or Chili Peppers. We added all those to our slice of pizza and the first bite had so much flavor. I did notice that once the piping hot pizza cooled off.. the pizza, itself became stale. The chewy crust was hard as old french bread. Eat it while it's hot and you're good. Once it cools off, good luck! Now to the dessert. I love their Tiramisu here. I absolutely have to order this every time I dine here. It's made in-house and so is their Cheesecake. The mascarpone custard is creamy, light, and soft. The coffee and rum were so balanced that nothing overpowered one another. If you're in the mood for sweets, this is definitely a place for great Tiramisu!!! At the end, Melissa, Elliott, and even the happy go manager lady thanked us for dining here and wished us to have a great day. A nice start to the first day of the week. Happy Monday ;)",real
"Best pizza in town! I associate pizza with snacking at school events, or lazy party food. I don't dislike pizza but would never order it at a restaurant. We went here for a friend's birthday, and pizza being their specialty, I ordered one! The thin doughy crust paired with the right amount of sauce and succulent toppings made this pizza restaurant my favorite in town. The pizza here is exactly like the ones I ate in Italy. After eating the pizza here, I gave other Italian restaurants a shot at their specialty pizzas and none of them were even close to it.",real

"Decided to take my wife here for her birthday and was completely satisfied with all aspects of our experience. We booked our reservation and was met promptly at the door and sat in our seats within one minute. Bread brought to the table and our waiter introduced himself and asked us for our drink orders and recommended a good wine based on our intended dinner choices. Robby has not only a great personality but was also great at suggesting a dinner that was not listed. I chose that suggestion and my wife chose the prime rib and both were outstanding! At the end of the meal, he also brought my wife a complimentary creme brulee for dessert and it too was delicious :-).",real
Outstanding Gyro place.  Their combo is $7.25 and comes with a healthy serving of fries and a large soda.  Their roasted red pepper humus is very good and the pita bread is fresh.  The shop itself looks brand new and well stocked.  I'd highly recommend this place.,real
"2 words: hemp milk. Don't gotta say much more. Coming here is a ""treat"" for myself because I live all the way by the M. It's ALWAYS worth it. Nothing beats your biggest iced dirty chai with hemp milk. Not all the Jameson in the world. Thanks MadHouse !!!",real

"Although it had only been open for a week by the time I stopped in, The Burger's Priest has already got its mojo in full gear.The Priest is all about purity, with a focus on serving awesome burgers and fries without the confusion of a thousand exotic toppings.The owner selects the beef every morning personally, then grinds it in fresh batches all day long.  Simple concept, but I swear I have eaten burgers all over the world, and I have never had one explode in my mouth with juicy tasty fresh perfection like this.  The fries are also exemplary, exactly the way I like them, not greasy, not too thick, not too thin.Congratulations!  I am a slave to your meat.",real

I recommend the whole menu heartily.",real
Looking for a place to sample this combo when you can sit on it.,fake
"This place was awesome! Amazing food, nice people and great service. Wish they had more than many places that could ask for anymore when I was in town from Indianapolis..  Awesome!  I had the papaya salad and a cinnamon roll at once.  I was still pleased to find better experience I've ever had. Great food and atmosphere.",fake
Best burgers in Vegas. French toast is so yummy. I can't say enough about how good this pizza is. And the customer service is great. Real authentic Mexican food. Would definitely recommend this place!,fake
"I used to frequent the location on E. Sunset, but found myself going less and less and craving more and more! It was just too far of a drive to go for. This location is next to my workplace, so I will definitely be frequenting for lunch. Their portions are huge, flavor is great, and the price is fantastic. This visit, I ordered a chicken bowl with tzatziki and pita on the side which was the bombdotcom. Like the other location, their food never fails. Step aside subway. If you want to ""eat fresh"" then this is the place to go.",real
Love this place.  Slightly better pizza/space.  Generous portions and fresh whipped cream that has pork chop and hot sauce made in house...,fake
"Great and affordable French bistro eats...in the heart of Montreal!Rus and I made reservations to dine here, and were greeted with extremely courteous service throughout the entirety of our meal.We ordered the french onion soup, beef tartare, duck confit and braised lamb shank. After ordering, the hostess walked us through the wine list and helped us choose something that would pair well with our meal. Wines by the glass were also very affordable (most of the options were under $10CAD/glass).The food was great! The french onion soup was rich and delicious. A bit on the breadier side, but I still enjoyed it very much. Rus also enjoyed the beef tartare. It came with fried capers, which I had never seen before (but they were delicious)!Our entrees were so good! I love the duck confit and the lamb shank was also very rich. The portions were pretty large, but so good that we just couldn't stop eating.We ended our meal with the creme brulee dessert (free with Yelp check-in), it was eh...but I won't complain about a free dessert (maybe spring for the bread pudding though)!Les Deux Gamins is perfect for a date-night outing. The ambience is perfect and the staff will make sure that you have a great experience.",real

The chopped salad was a good portion to the spice level up as they were busy and we were so short time customer and we will go back for sure on my next Vegas trip!",fake
Saw this place featured on the Food Network and had to try it! BAHN MI BURGER!!! Who knew that a pork-shrimp burger patty would be everything I ever wanted in life?? Pair that with the truffle fries (drizzled with their insane mushroom gravy) and you've got it made. So glad they opened up locations in Los Angeles!,real
"The inside is nothing to look at, but the food and service was incredible. Got the beer battered cod and was only able to finish half cause it was so big even though it was delicious, my SO got the pulled pork and didn't leave a scrap. Good beer selection, fries were OK, seasoned well. Service was quick. A little more expensive than I was expecting, but still worth it.",real
"The anticipation was filling the air with excitement, a buffet with a new twist, what could make this so much better than the dozen of others I had been to? Just the thought of individual serving bowls and plates filled with a couple of bites of delectable cuisine made me giddy. We weren't first in line but damn near close, and once seated, we were off to explore what we had been reading about now for weeks.  I started with the Asian side and brought back my first few selections.  Everything so neat and tidy in small take out boxes.  My first bites proof that the wait was worth it.After several plates and rounds, including a personal mac and cheese creation, t was off to the deserts.  The gold leafing was impressive, the different fudge mixes all seemed too unreal, overall this was a really exceptional meal.  I say, a good place to impress.",real
Both the Steaks and Pad Thai was delicious. Fish tacos were fantastic. If you are looking for a great authentic beer this place is a great place to go with friends or for a family dinner.,fake

"Vegan junk food at its finest! Spak Brothers is not a large restaurant, but the vegan options seem mouthwateringly endless. Let me tell you, they have one hell of a vegan philly cheese steak. This exceptional vegan junk food sandwich came with well-flavored seitan, green peppers, onions, lettuce, tomato, daiya cheese, and vegenaise all within some very tasty bread. Overall, this was one of my favorite meals in Pittsburgh, and I'll surely go back again during my next visit.",real

"So I've been to this place twice, the first time was a bar crawl and the second time waiting on a reservation at another restaurant. The first time we arrived late so we were only there for a short period. In that short period, we were greeted immediately by waitress and she tended to our needs. The second time the same waitress greeted and assisted us. It was trivia night, which we wish we could have partaked in the activity but our reservation was ready. As leaving, we encountered a regular of trivia night who gave us the run down on how it works. We were intrigued and definitely plan to attend in the near future. Additionally, I love sushi and we love to try theirs. I believe the waitress name was Amanda. She really knows the concept of customer service and how the the first 5 minutes determines how individuals view their experience.",real
"I stumbled into this restaurant while visiting Las Vegas.  If you are looking for authentic and great quality Korean food, this is the place.

"Fuego Bistro is a hidden treasure! A ""neighborhood"" restaurant and bar that we discovered years ago and have been back to many times. The staff are very friendly, helpful and anxious to please. The Owner Jeff, his wife and daughter are all actively involved, working to insure your complete satisfaction. All that having been said, it could be like many other restaurants, but then comes the food. The menu is unique in its own right, featuring a variety of meals. The quality, portions and taste of the food are, in this reviewers mind, the best we have ever experienced. I could go on with recommending various meals but would wind up naming everything on the menu. (Do try the seafood chili relleno). The place is very popular, so I recommend you make a reservation.

Postinos has it down when it comes to affordable date night, but with a classy ambiance.",real
"On my most recent dining experience at Cafe Zupas I had a slightly unpleasant experience.  My favorite Turkey Spinach Artichoke sandwich was very different.  The turkey definitely tasted like ham!  As someone who doesn't eat any pork I was a bit troubled by this.  I went up and inquired about this, I was informed that the restaurant was testing a new kind of turkey, supposedly a higher quality ... but was smoked.  For any others who can't or don't eat pork you know smoked anything still tastes like pork, and for some the mental association from the flavor as pork is too much.  I let them know at least my feedback on this and that others who don't eat pork would at least appreciate smoked* being noted on the menu, as I would have avoided this dish.Now, I believe I was talking to a manager, mostly because I have seen her working every single visit, said she appreciated the feedback and asked if she could make another sandwich for me.  Thank you Noe!  This is exactly what I consider excellent service!  While I am bummed my favorite dish has changed - I increased my rating from 4 to 5 stars because of the continued good experiences and now proven great customer service.",real

"I went here with my girlfriend and her cousin to grab a quick bite to eat, and really loved this place.Its like wild wings, only more laid back and with much better wings. You have your choice between naked or breaded, and they use rooster wings, not chicken wings, so they're gigantic!!BBQ and Honey Mustard was the poison I chose, and not a single one made it home that day.......I highly recommend this place for wings, trust me, you'll love it.The best wings I've had so far.",real

Kelly O's has quickly become our family favorite for breakfast!  The food is always awesome!  It is served hot and fresh off the grill. The French Toast is my favorite. It's made with Mancini's bread and sprinkled with butter and cinnamon sugar. My husband loves their turkey pot pie soup. Also if you have a chance to try the Banana Bread French Toast- you must!!!!!!  Yum!,real
"5 stars for delicious food, great service, and pleasant anterior. Had a very pleasant experience here with my boyfriend. I love that they have prominent vegan and vegetarian options, along with seafood and meat!! But it's so hard to find vegan and vegetarian options in this town, so I was eager to try one if their entrees. Our service was very nice and attentive. I also liked to see that the manager was in the front of the house, attentively doing his job, unlike most who just sit in their office. I also loved the interior and decor of the restaurant. The view is also great; they just need a beach to replace the airport!",real
"Bitter & Twisted kind of reminds you of what you DO not want in your life! The twisted ex; the bitter ex-friend; maybe the twisted sister ; or maybe the bitter boss who makes YOU slowly become BITTER and then TWISTED by weeks end. Well, enter this amazing place to un-do all of the above.. I have been here twice now and it's a great addition to the downtown PHX scene! Housed on the street level floor of the Luhrs Building with a long architectural history dating back to the 1800's, Bitter & Twisted still seems to continue that 'Beaux Arts' theme in its decor; I love the big long drapes and the thick comfy couches.. the tall ceiling and dim lighting keep the theme alive. Happy Hour here is busy! Don't bring a giant group and expect to saunter in and belly up to the bar either ; Bitter doesn't work that way! Expect to wait with your group, be patient and you will eventually get one of those nice plush couches or a great table with a great team of wait staff. Tip: download the 'No Wait' app and get on the list prior to decrease your wait. The drinks on Happy Hour are awesome and they go until 7pm. Also another legit greatness about this place. There is the : Thrifty Cocktail, ( the mixology choice of the day); The Fresh Fruit Blend; $5 Prosecco , just to name a few of the HH highlights. On the last visit , I had a HH mojito with muddled fresh blackberries.. It came in a large pint glass! NOT a usual small 'happy hour, this is on special' glass. It was fresh, pretty, ( I like drinking pretty drinks ), and NOT too sweet , ( whereas I like pretty drinks, I don't care for overly sweet ones.. yeah. that.) The food menu is unique and perfect for this trendy, chic cocktail lounge. For example: The  MOMO Burger ! It's made out of crisped Ramen buns! ( Yes. I said 'ramen' , as in 'starving-in-college' ramen noodles).  Inside those buns of ramen is an ample soy marinated patty that's topped with carmelized onions, pepper jack cheese, jalapeño mayo and a little Siracha mixed with soba sauce. YUM! This burger has been much talked about in The Phoenix New Times ; The Thrillist ; AzCentral .. JUST to name a few! The rest of the menu is Asian inspired small plates but also Bitter & Twisted has a very amazing charcuterie plate that comes with a small ramekin of amazing pate and wonderful fresh bread! One of my favorite charcuterie plates in all of the valley. The drink menu is also unique and literally, A BOOK! This book describes all your latest or not so late things made into unique mixmaster cocktails that lead to what else .. being Twisted. BUT by now, it's in a good way:-) There are great beers, wines, bubbles and all the usual premium alcohols here for those that like it neat and not mixed. If the cocktail map leaves you confused , the bartenders are some of the best and they will help you out with your 'needs' ; complete talent! I can't rave enough about this great place that graces downtown Phoenix. Oh and they will validate for the parking garage on Madison/1st. Happy twisting!",real

"The Phoenix is the best coffee shop in the area, tucked away in the heart of Ohio City. My go to is their ""Nitro Toddy"" (which is not for the caffeine sensitive!). The cheap prices, trendy appearance and happy employees make the Phoenix the type of place you want to return to. They have a rewards program that automatically keeps track of your reward status through your credit card which is super convenient. Basically every 10 drinks gets you a drink worth up to $5(ish). You will see a lot of familiar Ohio City faces meeting here and a lot of regulars who use the shop to work off their laptops. I believe they are dog friendly and have a very cool little patio. Stop in and check them out, you won't be disappointed!",real

They have their own specialty rolls, and I love them all so I recommend trying them out. Nope, not just one. All!

I love this place because I don't even like burrito but here and home fries are amazing.I tried the Chicken Strips and their Salmon and Mac N Cheese which got it on the patio. My friend got was soooo good too. I will be visiting at least 5 times a week. I always have a great experience and I have to say it's the best pizza in Vegas! Love there sandwiches and salads.

"I stayed at Mandalay Bay for 3 nights and this restaurant and Hussong's Cantina were the only places I ate not only because they had the most vegan options, but also because they were SO GOOD. At Slice of Vegas, we were seated immediately by a super friendly hostess and the waitress immediately came over and was very accommodating to me being vegan and my friend being non-vegan (making sure she knew which meal was vegan and which wasn't). I think I had almost everything on their vegan menu. Even my non-vegan friend loved it! Next time I go to Vegas, I know where I'm taking everyone!",real
"I started going to Phil's when I moved to Fountain Hills in 2010. At first I went because my name is also Phil and I wanted to meet this guy and see what his restaurant was like. I was pleasantly surprised at the selection, the service, and, when I got my first meal there, the quality of the food and it's preparation. I soon became a regular, and our church uses Phil to cater some of our events. It's Also one of the preferred ""Go to"" places for breakfast or lunch after church. Yes, the Coca Cola theme is nice, the view is great, and Phil is a wonderful guy. But the main reason you need to go to Phil's is the FOOD! PS. They have a loyalty program, and they are Biker friendly. I moved back to Chicago for two years, went back there yesterday, and it's even better than before. They've upgraded their appetizer menu and it's awesome!",real
"Great food, generous portions, great ambience, the wait staff was on point and the service was awesome. The food was good. The owners were attentive and friendly. This company my family and I love this place! .. I like the chicken shawarma and the fresh bread and gourmet sausage are my favorite! The servers are happy and helpful. All the dishes have a very nice set up.",fake
I love this place! Great food and ambiance! The baked lobster appetizer and the drinks were exceptional.  The meat was nothing short of amazing.  got the sweet potato fries and a side of the chicken wings. They are fabulous!  I highly recommend this place if you haven't yet. Staff is always friendly and food comes out quick. Come here every week.,fake
"Best new takeout spot downtown. The chicken kothu roti is unbelievable. Very few places serving fresh to order food like this. Authentic spices and herbs, fresh veggies, very reasonably priced. All around 5-star.",real
We have been to this place a lot eating at three days in a row because it is a nice little diner.,fake
"I had a fantastic evening here! After making a reservation originally for 8, we showed up a few minutes late and only had 7 but they were completely accommodating and understanding. I had the Brusselsprout hash and added goat cheese (again, no complications) and it was so delicious! They refilled our drinks regularly and the staff were all polite and relaxed. One of my friends flatbreads came out 5 minutes later than the rest of the food, which wasn't a huge deal for us, but the manager came and apologized personally and not only comped her food but gave us a free Pineapple Upside Down Cake for the table to share! This was easily one of the best experiences I've had here and will always be a loyal customer! Between the interesting and tasty food, the downtown location, and the awesome decor and atmosphere, it is a definite Must every time I come home.",real

Fresh pizza with fresh and great staff.  The ambiance is very small and the restaurant is very clean! Would definitely recommend others!,fake
"My all time favorite place for sushi. Amazing food, terrific wait staff, and attention to detail.  We really enjoyed our lunch here.  The Pad Thai was great.  I really enjoyed the triple s at Rachel's (noodles and chopped salad dish), it was delicious.  I enjoyed my ramen and the coconut shrimp was the best I've had since I ate there!",fake
The German pancake is amazing!! 2 people can totally share it. This is our new spot. It's super soft. We got the caramel apple topping. Best breakfast around.,real
Great place!  And the staff is friendly. Bartenders are amazing.  I recommend the tacos and they have the best everything.,fake
"Fantastic food and service.  I'm a big fan of their chicken curry and the breakfast burrito is amazing and the prices are reasonable.   My boyfriend and I try to plan a visit when I want to have a great brunch on the weekend and the brisket and sundaes excellent. This is one of the best restaurants in the area, so when I am in Las Vegas, I met my staple and have a good time.",fake
Super tasty tapas! Creative plates. Delicious!My server Nikki was well informed on all the dishes and I pretty much just followed her suggestions.,real
"I now believe this is the best restaurant in Las Vegas.  My Dad and I had our Christmas Dinner here (a few days early).  I had the most perfectly cooked and tender Filet Mignon with their signature zip sauce (which they should bottle, it is so good) with a side of Angel Hair pasta with tomato/marscapone sauce.  My dad had shrimp scampi with the same pasta.  It was so simple, but so unbelievably good.  Our server Joaquin was one of the best.  Their service is beyond outstanding.  Everything they do is top notch.  if it is not the best restaurant in Vegas, it is in the top five.  I know if I were a local businessman who wanted to entertain an out of town client, this would certainly be the place that I would take them.  I cannot wait to go back.",real
Amazing oysters! . small place that has a nice vegan menu and the service is good for the high quality seafood. The service was fantastic! My mom is always friendly and the rolls are huge and amazing.  This place is a must for my family and friends from out of town.,fake

"This place was recommended by a friend for best burgers so on our last day, we swung by for lunch.  Little did we know it was more of a night joint that we were the first ones and the only ones there eating for lunch, but the staff was really friendly and personable.  He told us about the history of the place and how their burgers were unique: coal fired.  I just ordered their Classic Cheeseburger while my husband had the Peppercorn Burger.  Also ordered some fries.  When the burger came out, it was stacked really high.  I'm not sure if the meat was 1/3 or 1/2 lb, but it was big!  I had to smash it down to even take a bite.  It came out on a antique pewter like plate which made it unique.  Ended up eating the whole thing which was surprising, but I did skip breakfast.  I would definitely consider coming back when in town!",real
The pizza was delicious and the set up is cool. The whole idea of using their card for the different stations was really great I've never seen anything else like it. Awesome!,real
Great place! We sat outside for the Summerlin and the teriyaki chicken.  The Italian beef and tomato soup is to die for.,fake
I loved their Mexican food and the prices are just right. Cool atmosphere. A bit pricey but you get what you pay for.,fake
We happened to drive by this place not even knowing about it. My family are huge sea food eaters as I am not. But this place is absolutely amazing. Service is fast servers are very respectful. We will never go to another sea food restaurant after eating here. Only down fall is this place is so popular they don't have enough room and they don't have southern sweet tea.  Hoping they will expand soon. I highly recommend this place.,real
One of my favorite restaurants by far!!! They have an awesome gluten free menu and a gluten free desert that is to die for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The restaurant itself is beautiful and the bar area is so unique. You just can't take your eyes off of it. The way they have the bottles organized on the wall with the lighting is awesome and an art piece in itself. The service there is always top notch which is a plus for me. Its probably a good thing that I don't live closer because I would be in there everyday. lol Love this place.,real
"All good things to say here.Service:  attentive, timely, precise.Food:  not a moment of unhappiness from our party of 4.  Beef was well aged with appropriate flavor.Drinks:  full and well-made.Atmosphere:  I've been going to Scottsdale and Phoenix for 30 years from NY and DC, there's nothing lacking in sophistication here.  Hopping, does not miss a beat.Was recommended by a friend from NY.  44 was the dining highlight of our vacation.",real
This was our Octape when we were still in town. Starting with the seafood tower (grilled cheese) and the cheese plate with rice. Servers were super friendly and service was good. Very kind and friendly.,fake
I eat at this location frequently and never had any issues - the 2 sides and 1 meat is a ton of food for under $6. Double meat for $1 extra. I really like their orange and bourbon chicken. Lemon is pretty good too. Workers are very nice.,real
Best sushi in Phoenix! Great place to take a date or just deciding which food for 20 and they did a great job.,fake
This place is awesome! Great service and food. If your looking for fresh food this is your place,fake
"Saw this place on Groupon and did not know what to expect. Sometimes these Groupon experiments do not end well, but for Copper Still it could not have been better. The beer was delicious. Pulled pork was out of this world. Smoked to perfection just how real BBQ should be. The poblano pasta was spicy and delicious as well. The staff is friendly and very attentive. The owner Steve walked around and said hi just like a little hometown joint. Abby is the exact replica of a perfect waitress. If you are considering it you will not be disappointed when you come to The Still.",real
"The food was really good and the service was great. The calamari appetizer was perfectly spiced, and the salsa was soooo good. We highly recommend the Gainey sausage and pepper shrimp. Great vibe, and a lot of places up the issues. We also had the fish tacos and she loved it! We will be back!",fake
My favorite pizza place in the valley. Hands down. This is a great little place....the food is so fresh and tasty! Love the Hawaiian and the sorry Roberto's!!,fake
"Always a favorite place to go for breakfast. First time here, but the food was great! I am thrilled to see you they have a great performance of things added in a store with two great food choices.",fake
OMG. Probably the best ramen in town.  My favorite is the pork belly and the Chicken Fried Italian.,fake
Great customer service organized at all.Nice people...,fake
"Excellent pizza, service and reasonably priced. We will be back again to this hidden gem. We found it quite by accident and I am glad we did. Just the smell of the wood fired oven was worth the trip. Watch out for the serrano peppers growing outside, they have a bite!",real
"Really enjoyed myself! We went here for dinner and a drinky. Tuesday special is chicken fried steak. It was pretty good, 8 out of 10. Reverse happy hour starts at 8. Half off appetizers and dollar off drafts. Had a house merlot for 2.50 that was pretty dlish. I will definitely be back here!Happy hour starts at 8 PM... Awesome! Food is Awesome! My new favorite place! Go there...NOW!",real
"The food here is delicious! the service is great, the portions are small but the service is always top notch. Food is great and service is excellent. The restaurant is cute and they are very friendly.",fake
"First time I came here, was from what I read about it on yelp--the food quality was great and loved the quiet ambiance. Since then, I've come here pretty much every month, sometimes alone or with family. I've introduced my family & friends to this place, and they all love it as well. You get endless veggies and a complimentary dessert and the service lady is really nice.  The pricing is very reasonable. The food is healthy.  I've tried numerous other places (in Las Vegas, Dallas, LA, Houston, Atlanta, Honolulu) and this place rocks!  The regular order of beef is AWESOME (fresh and not semi-frozen). Once you've tried this place, you won't want to try anywhere else that serves shabu-shabu/sukiyaki.",real
"I reserve this place for all the special occasions in my life. The ambiance is romantic and elegant: it's dimly lit with soft candlelights, a piano bar on the main floor and exposed wine fridges as you head upstairs to the dining room. ... but nothing beats that smell of salty, mouth watering meat! Must-have sides: Caesar salad: prepared table side, this salad is delicious without being too creamy;Potato puree: a fluffly cloud from heaven in your mouth;Creamed spinach: because vegetables are healthy and this is so tasty;Duck fat fries: everything good in life, in every bite. Sides worth passing up: Rapini: while this side is truly delicious, I've been able to recreate it at home; Potato gratin: in a war between the potatoes, the puree always wins! Mushrooms: I get this 50% of the time because they're so much value added but too simple to justify spending $16 on.Now let's talk meat! I've personally never spent the ~1k on the kobe beef, but i've heard spectacular things and cannot judge anyone who splurges. From my experience, the wait staff typically make the best recommendations on their meat, but I almost always end up ordering the bone-in porterhouse, medium-rare to rare. I am never disappointed! This place is a perfect 10/10 from their fluffy starter bread, to their take-home muffins!",real
This place is fantastic. The Hong Kong special is out of this world good. I highly recommend it to everyone.,real
Great food. The buffalo chicken pizza is to die for. Guacamole tacos are fantastic!,fake
Really good food here it's a bar and a sit down eatery good drinks with daily specials the ribs are really good.

"Loved it! I figured since it was inside New york, new york hotel/casino that we couldn't go wrong with this place being new york style. This is the first stromboli i've ever and it was so amazing. It was ham stomboli. My boyfriend got the calzone and liked it too. It was hard to get a table but that's cause it's obviously popular. Especially when you do not want a restaurant and prefer something faster but yet you can still sit down and eat. Would come back if ever in Vegas again.",real
"Great food, great service friendly staff. I eat there at least once a week. They always get my order right and the food is always hot and fresh. It is a popular Spot so much but this is in the bar and service is pleasant - thank you for the great service!",fake
"Been here twice and love it! Service is good, food is fresh and great. I like how they have a large variety of tapas on their AYCE menu rather than strictly sushi. Great for those who want other things besides seafood. Their roll with peanut butter is so good!! I love trying different and new rolls.",real
"I absolutely love this place for some good gyros I can say is yum! Good food, prices and portion. Most especially wrong! Ordered the chicken lo mein, it was soooo gooood!",fake
"Great place to grab a bite to eat after a long night of drinking or if you don't know what to order, then not have to wait in line but it's worth it.  My favorite is the crispy fish - creamy cheese and crust for an appetizer ! They are perfectly made and the service is good. Charming decor, and a good atmosphere. We have been memorable visits and will definitely be back!!",fake

"Fantastic Wisconsin bar food, especially Friday night Fish Fry (I usually order the lemon-pepper grilled walleye and my husband likes the traditional fried cod), soft pretzels with cheese sauce, burgers and homemade soups. I like Dexter's for lunch as well and think that the homemade soup and fresh side salad is one of the best deals for lunch in Madison. Stellar rotation of tap beers that are well curated. There is frequently something new and delicious to try. Their beer selection spans many different beer styles, breweries, and regions of the country. I appreciate that they don't try to do it by having a million on tap all the time. The staff can always speak to the beer that I inquire about and are happy to provide a sample before you order a full glass. In general, the service is always friendly.Don't forget to ask for a cupcake!",real
Went for a late lunch and I loved the shawarma sandwich.  We will definitely be back.,fake

Delicious and amazing food. We had the Miso soup and the shrimp pudding bombshell and it all comes out hot and delicious.,fake
This is far and away the best pizza joint in Cleveland. I grew up in Philly and so I am partial to east coast style hand tossed. Crust nails it. They oil and salt their crust which makes it even better. If it weren't for Crust I don't know that I could live in Cleveland. The second best pizza here isn't even close. Please give this place all your business.,real
"I love this place, it's just about the best Mexican I have had in years...but it's closing thanks to señor frogs. They have a contract that they can be the only Mexican restaurant in TI.

"This buffet was awesome. We got lucky, we got there right before lunch ended, so paid the lunch price but ate the dinner entrees. Unlike any other buffet Ive ever eaten at, I enjoyed everything I tried. They even cut the crab legs lengthwise, instead of just scoring them. Left full and happy and ready for a nap.",real
They have the best tasting waffles I've ever tried. It's just like a hole in the wall but they offer the best breakfast ever. Will definitely be back with more friends in tow.,real

Good food, good service, great selection of food. Has a ton of choices (about the teas) recommend to order the beef brisket sandwich which is a steady rice plate and the coffee is great. Lots of options to choose from. I only came for take out and everything was the best corned beef I've ever had! My sister had breakfast here. The breakfast buzz is awesome! The biscuits are amazing. Their staff is friendly and efficient. They even gave us a sample of many other dishes. Street corn and carne asada fries are amazing. The prices are reasonable. Definitely a weekly visit to Phoenix",fake
"When I found out there was a Boiling Crab in Vegas I was so excited! I have only been to the locations in California which were all extremely crowded and always had a long wait time for a table. I came to this location on a Sunday. I was surprised to be seated right away no wait time! This location is HUGE! Which I loved. A lot of people come here in groups so being able to be seated right away with only a party of 2 was nice. We ordered a pound each of the shrimp and crawfish then a lobster all with the whole sha-bang sauce medium. Also we ordered corn on the cob and potatoes. I'm very picky about my seafood so when the order came out I was very happy that it was hot, fresh, and not overcooked. I couldn't believe the size of the lobster it was huge and well worth the price. This will still continue to be one of my favorite seafood restaurants and I will continue to come back!",real
I am glad I did. They are entirely teached. It is all good. The staff is friendly. Even though it's closed.,fake

"I'm from New Jersey and I worked in an Italian/pizza restaurant for years. I know pizza. Not to sound like a fatty, but I've been in Pittsburgh for 8 years on a mission for people to understand that your average pizza here is just all wrong (don't get me started on the bagels). Pizza sola is the best pizza in town...aside from the wood burning oven pizza at piccolo forno, but that's different. I'm appalled by the bad reviews, really. I understand sometimes the dudes working there look...tired? maybe that's the word? But I'm not aware of any other places where you can get slices displayed in cases, just like home. The crust could be a little thinner, and they could probably have more options available on average, but it's great. Also they use better ingredients. Lastly, their housemade blue cheese for the salads is like....the greatest. Okay, done talking like a fatty. Go here for your hangover cure or anytime you won't feel guilty eating the giant fatty slices.The cranberry location needs a little work but is still good. I think southside is still best. And it's nice that there's beer at the oakland one.",real
"Hands down the best food I have ever had! Craft will undoubtedly be one of my stops the next time I go to Vegas. It's definitely pricey, but well worth it in my opinion. The steak is so tender and juicy, you can cut it with a fork. Everything is absolutely amazing at this restaurant!!!",real
I had the best deli and this place was so good. The pizza was amazing! Best part is they are all good!,fake
Always good! My favorite specialty pizza and wings will moke!!!! I wouldn't think that it was such a good experience! The food was great and the service was good. The menu deserves 5 stars.

Took my monday night and the service was excellent. The food was really good. The wonton soup was great. The staff was very friendly and the burgers were also fantastic. We will be back for sure!,fake
Sunday morning has the best servers on the planet.  Love the recipes vegan cookies and the peanut Butter breast (beef and lamb) everything we ate was amazing.

"We went on the 2nd night of the  soft opening. Tldr: this unique Royal Thai cuisine experience makes me want to go to Thailand for real. Starting from my drink, to the apps, then mains and lastly dessert, everything was special, beautiful, delicious and memorable. I did not want to finish my last bite. My faves:Pandan Thai iced tea - slightly sweetened, nice Pandan taste, fun colour visual. Great fun way to start the meal.Khao Yum - rice in 3 colours with various herbs and tamarind soy sauce. I've never seen anything like it! I liked it the taste more with lime.Braised beef short rib - so tender, and the gravy/curry-like sauce is something I could eat on its own with just rice.Roy Thai - platter of 4 different style dumplings. Incredibly creative, nice play on visual and flavour. I had to share each bite but you won't want to share...Fruit platter dessert - these fruits are imported from Thailand. Never have I tasted such ripe fruits from Thailand. The mango!! Ripe for 2 months of the year! It melts in your mouth!! This is like the Kobe beef of fruits!! Mangosteen - first time trying it. I'm definitely going to buy these at the grocery store now! I'm hooked! Pomelo and rambutan - ok, these were not as mind blowing as the first two fruits. We were pretty full after the mains but after tasting the fruits, we would have been able to keep going... Can't wait to see their expanded and perfectly crafted menu in the future! Definitely coming back. Awesome job Kiin team, Chef Nuit and Jeff!",real
"I've been coming here for over 10 years and it's been consistently great for all 10 years.  I've eaten here probably over 50 times and it's always good. I've tried other AYCE places and they never compare to Sushi Mon. Great selection of fish and the absolute best part is they will make any roll they offer into a hand roll and they'll customize it for you.  I've been to other restaurants that look at you like you're crazy for even asking.  They never pressure you about the 1 hour time limit,  and the service is very good considering how busy they are.  My suggestion is don't bring small children that don't enjoy any form of Japanese food, the place is super busy to have to manage a baby and frustrating for fellow diners. (rant over) can't recommend this place enough and can't wait to go back.",real

"Wow!  Hands down, one of the best sushi restaurants I've been too. Easily in my top three. The fish is so incredibly fresh and Sonny did an excellent job with pairing the fish with amazing sauces and seasoning that complimented and fully brought out the flavor of the fish. I can't recommend this place enough. Will definitely be my go to place for sushi when in Vegas. Do yourself a favor and grab a seat at the bar in front of Sonny and his crew.  You will not be disappointed!  I recommend the Red Snapper for Two, salmon belly, toro, and ocean trout.",real
Hands down the best Thai food in town. They are very friendly and have a great staff.  Can't recommend it enough.,fake
"Les meilleurs œufs bénédictines en ville. Mes favoris sont brie, bacon et avocats mais les ayant tous essayés je vous garantis qu'ils sont tous bons. Le décor assez simple mais charmant avec des expositions qui changent au fil du temps pourrait avoir l'air hipster pour certains, moi j'aime! Le cafe latté est savoureux et crémeux à souhait, je sais que plusieurs bons cafés sont à proximité mais le Vieux vélo est even better. Et le prix! On adore. Des déjeuners a 10-12$ et cafés à 2$, on s'en sort en bas de 20$. Évidemment l'endroit est populaire le weekend mais habituellement le roulement est bon. On y retourne encore et encore!",real

"I live in Mesa, but any time I'm headed out downtown I think of Mi Patio. I was first taken there with a friend who grew up in the area, and now I take the guests! The taco salad is big, filling, and tasty- get the shredded chicken, and say yes to the guac and sour cream. The Baja Burrito comes in the most amazing cream sauce- get that dish with rice and mix it all up. Top it off with a $3.50 huge margarita- it must be close to 30 oz- they are the cheaper ""sweet mix"" taste, but the price is right!",real
"Great neighborhood place! Our waiter, Krysten was extremely knowledgeable about the food.  Will definitely go back on a year.",fake

"Yesterday we had an early dinner  here with friends. Three of us ordered the Barbecue Salmon Salad and it was fantastic! A generous, perfectly cooked piece of salmon with a light barbecue sauce was served to the side of the salad. The salad was a nice mixture of greens, mandarin oranges, spiced pecans, corn tortilla straws, served with a sweet citrus vinaigrette dressing. I would go back just to have this again.",real
Great coffee place...you have to try it to believe that they got the best latte! We had Nutella and Velvet  Latte it was so delicious.,real
Great place had the soft Shell crab sandwich and it was great also had the fish and chips it was also fantastic good place to eat if you love seafood,real
Absolutely delicious. I was hesitant to try the chicken pot stickers and the French toast. We sat at the bar and tried the cilantro margarita--- both burger and spicy pork. The quality of the meat is good but it says hi fresh watering. The pizza is very good and the lamb vindaloo was perfect. Great service and we will be back.,fake
This place has the best coffee and also all of the food is great.,fake

The best meal I have had in weeks.  Service was perfect.  Sushi was great. Meal was great.  Restaurant was clean and comfortable.  Short wait time. Drink had the perfect favor server was attentive and fast and was about to answer all of questions and was very personable.  I rarely give 5 stars but they surely deserve it.  I will be returning with a group for sure.,real
"Really impressed. Lunch menu is almost too reasonably priced. Started with perfect garlic bread. Crisp edge but soft inside. Minestrone or salad come with dinner, both delicious. We got baked ziti, shrimp fettucini alfredo, tortellini al panna, saltimboca. All of it was great. All were great. Got lemon cheesecake creme brule and the hot brownie and vanilla. Last one won the table but all were great. Will come again, great service.",real
"This place is a hidden gem. Probably one of the coolest restaurants I've been to in Tempe. Overlooking the lake, it's gorgeous! We came in for Sunday brunch. The menu was great and drink specials were awesome too. We got the DIY mimosas for 15$. It comes with a bottle of champagne and your choice of juice. We got cranberry and pineapple for our mimosas. Super yummy! For food we ordered mahi mahi fish tacos, tri tip sandwich with au ju and delicious crispy French fries, and a berry salad with seared ahi which was to die for! The atmosphere was wonderful, they even had live music at the bar. For the cooler seasons they have a little fire pit on the patio right in the water. We loved the captains lounge which has sofas, a pool table, and life size jenga. There's also a patio where you can play darts. Such a fun place. Can't wait to come back!",real
"Great service, great food, great everything! Chef was very helpful and kind. Place has a nice vibe.",real
OMG Thanks to steak and eggs heaven it was delicious. Definitely will go back again.,fake
"A very small hole in the wall place, had the calorie chicken breast and curry dish. So fresh and perfectly cooked! Tastes so fresh and delish!",fake
"Ask for Ralph. The restaurant appears fancy and stuffy, but he is a real professional. We were not dressed up, but he treated us with a great deal of friendly respect. I asked for a special order basil gimlet and he made sure it was done correctly for me. He also suggested that I split two of the entrees, giving me half of each, given that the butternut ravioli is very rich. What a great suggestion! And what a great meal. This is what fine dining should be, from tasty breads through great service. Eat here!",real
I've been coming here for a few years now and they have always had amazing food that is very consistent as I have ordered a few items over. The staff is always nice and helpful. I highly recommend coming in here.,real
Don't let the neighborhood but one can get really well and comes with a queso ricotta cheese.,fake
"Absolutely delicious! The black pepper shrimp was the best I ever had. So fresh, and delicious. Definitely will be back.",fake
"I don't normally give 5 stars out, but I haven't had better. This place is great!The Spicy Tan Tan has just the right amount of spice. Not overpowering, yet an enjoyable level of spice. The pork shoulder was done just right and the cut was ideal. The egg was exactly perfectly medium. I ordered mine with the thick noodle; however, I would suggest ordering this dish with the thin noodle.I also had the deep fried chicken starter which was also delicious.I would definitely return to this location. Especially once they receive their LLBO :P",real
"What a fantastic place... in Elyria?! Yep! That's correct! It's on the corner of a shopping plaza but you know what people say, they say places in plazas have the best food. Well if you love Stromboli or pizza this rings true!My date and I sat at the bar and had wonderful service. They have a great draft and bottle selection. I didn't care for the patio because it wreaked of smoke. There was nowhere for the smoke to go so we couldn't sit outside with the smell.We ordered the deep fried pretzel sticks which if my metabolism wasn't slowing down, I would eat every single day! They stayed soft even when they cooled down and who doesn't love some good runny orange cheese! Seriously soooo good! We each also ordered a Stromboli. Holy amazingness! I loved the dough the best if I had to choose one ingredient to love more than others. I also used the ranch more than the marinara and this might be a foodie no no, but I broke the rules this time by using ranch. Either way these things are crazy good and no, you should not share!*Note: You don't need extra cheese because these bad boys are fully loaded!",real
"We have walked by this place so many times on our way to munchies. Finally we made it a point of going here, after salivating at the food for this long. This place did not disappoint. Incredible food, staff here are amazing. The drinks were delicious, get the bulldog on special that day. We had the portobello fajitas and 9 layer dip. So damn good. Best Mexican food we've had. Our new go to! Awesome job to everyone at this place. Keep doing what you're doing.",real
"One of the hidden gems in the Avon lake/ Elyria area.The food was very tasty. Service was great and I left full and happy :) I was actually surprised by the humbleness and his wife who is Thai. They purchase their ingredient fresh from Cleveland everyday, which shows the level of efforts they put in their restaurant.The food is great and I also would recommend the bubble tea, which mind taste different but if you are open to trying new things, IT IS TASTY!",real
"Awesome food and service at the bar both times, the food and service is always great with pretty quick energy.",fake
I dream about this place! Sandwiches are pretty good too. Their blueberry cheesecake is my favorite.,fake
"Had a blast here - the food was great, and prepared around our (vegan) dietary needs.  Thanks so much!!!   Even got to chat with the owner about their trips to and from Chautauqua :)",real
Good food and always a great time. Good place to grab a bite.,fake
Food is awesome!!!! This is the second day in a row that we eat breakfast from 5th Ave Cafe... Both days were to go so I can't post a review on the service when dinning in!!!! Good prices,real
"A long time customer, having migrated with Sheila and John from the initial Carefree Highway location, I am delighted that this once small restaurant has blossomed into the ultra-successful neighborhood jewel that we see today.  At first I was skeptical of the relocation; on her signature Wednesday buttermilk chicken night, we'd see six or seven tables and maybe a few folks at the bar.  Fast forward to last Wednesday: we arrived a little after 5 and John apologized saying they were totally booked until after eight o'clock.  The bar was full.  It happens that John was able to put us in a table in the bar, which area we normally avoid.  However our bartender/server Vince, and alter ego Conor, redefined great service.  The servers here are all terrific, but these guys were something else.  Utterly attentive, accurate with our orders and congenial to a fault, they made us feel as though we were the only guests in the crowded bar.  Of course Sheila's mastery of all things edible causes people to return again and again.  And it's become more classy and intimate as time goes on.  But I think what makes Soul Cafe the great restaurant it is today is more than that.  It's people like John and Vince and Conor that make the place special.  I look forward to greater success in the future and I'll be sure to make a reservation on our next visit.",real
"Yummy!! My husband isn't usually adventurous when it comes to food (I blame the red gene) but he took me here for lunch. We ordered the brisket, some skirt steak, chicken, and a few appitizers. I'm not much of a beef person, but the brisket was amazing! We ordered a second helping of it. They give you a lot of meat. The only thing I wish they had was veggies. Service was great! Place was clean. Will definitely be back.",real
Yes yes yes !!!!! Fish is fantastic - moist on the inside and a beautiful fry to finish !!!! Shrimp is just as good - big and juicy too!!! Didn't get a chance to try the fries but as they tossed the garlic fries my mouth was watering.,real
"I had the chicken pesto fondue as well, and the bartender was very friendly. We will definitely be returning and take advantage of this place on our trip.",fake
Yummy goodness! If you haven't been here your missing out!! So much better than the other Chinese restaurant in the area... Too bad I could eat here everyday! Soo good here.,fake
"I love this place on the weekends for live music and great bar staff, however I heard through friends they have good food. So Friday the 6th of March I stopped over there for a late lunch and ordered the marinated mixed vege dish. It came with a skewer of chicken and a skewer of filet both had grilled veges of onions, red peppers, and mushrooms which were amazing. The dish also came with  lime cilantro rice, but I am not a rice fan and our server let me choose whatever else i wanted to substitute it with. I choose grilled asparagus, some of the best i ever had. For 14$, this plate was filling and mouth watering. Our server Ashley was sweet and catering too which added to our great experience.",real
"I absolutely LOVE Defalco's! Quaint, charming, one-of-a kind place with authentic Italian Food. What more could you ask for?Start of RANT: In perusing some of the other reviews I noticed some yelpers don't agree with my rating. Sorry, but who in their right mind goes to an Italian Grocery and DOESN'T order Italian food, then gives the place a poor rating? WTH? I don't go to Mexican place, order a pasta and expect them to experts at it. End of RANT.Back to the review. I had the combo sandwich cold, while my partner had the Italian Sausage with peppers and onions. Both were excellent and the service was great.Now if we only had a place like this up in the vast wasteland called Desert Ridge.",real
"Came here with my friends for Brunch. LOVE the portions, and love the food even more. The service was excellent. I was surprised by how big the portions were, I've been to a couple of Brunch place and they don't normally serve you a big portion. Make sure you rsvp in advance! They book up really quickly!! And check in you get 10% discount :)",real
First time eating at the District! Come here often and have the food at the bar!,fake
Great lunch specials. All you can eat sushi and 2 of my favorite rooms.,fake
"WOW. I was not expecting such a good joint (even with 4.5 stars on Yelp). What do you think when you hear ""To Go"" in a, Asian restaurant's name? Probably pre-made, oily, salty vats of food scooped up into paper boxes and Styrofoam container accompanied by underwhelming side selections. This is far from that.Despite the somewhat dilapidated exterior and slightly cheesily decorated interior, there is a lot of character to this small family-run joint. As you walk in, to your left is a mural of a river market in Thailand. To your right on the far wall there are menu items listed with pictures of their specials. The tables and chairs are what you'd expect from a middle-of-the-road restaurant; the tables are sturdy and the chairs look to be fairly new. On the tables are the traditional condiments for Thai food (chili pastes, pickled jalepeño slices, and other spicy yums). The man who was our server, who I assume to be the owner, is a jolly, middle-aged Thai gentleman by the name of Yai(?). What he lacks in his ability to speak English well he certainly makes up for in character. He was very attentive  to my family's table and seemed to make his best effort to make sure we were content. Boy, were we beyond content!ON TO THE FOOD! What we ordered and their ratings out of 5 stars:Vegetable Egg Rolls: 3 of 5- Pretty standard egg rolls. They were good, not great, but they were presented nicely with some sweet and sour sauce and were good enough to be gone by the end of dinner.Pad Thai with Chicken: 5 of 5- So, let me start out by saying that I usually don't like pad thai; it just isn't my thing. We got it because it's my parents' favorite. My parents loved it and I loved it. It had the standard vegetables and chopped peanuts, but the sauce and noodles were what made the dish work so well. The noodles were soft but not chewy, and they didn't stick together. The sauce was slightly spicy, because we asked for it that way, but not overwhelming nor bland.Pad See Eu with Beef: 5 of 5- Now this is my favorite dish to get at Thai food places. I loved the one they made for me here. The vegetables were slightly crisp, the noodles were nice and chewy, and the beef was tender. One of the biggest problems I have with other places' pad see ews is that there either too much or too little sauce; I didn't have this problem here.Crispy Pork with Broccoli: 4 of 5- This dish had a lot of flavor. If you like garlic without it overpowering the dish, this would be something for you.  As with the pad see eu, the broccoli was cooked to perfection. My only issue with this dish is that the pork was a little too chewy/dry for my liking (but maybe that's how it was supposed to be).Sticky Rice with Mango Slices: 5 of 5- Just the right amount of sweetness from the mango and coconut milk. The rice had a great texture and went well with the mango. A must try!Overall, my family was very pleased with it's experience. This is my new favorite Thai food place. We are definitely going to visit again before we leave Vegas.",real
"Great place. Good prices, friendly service.  We got three times in a row while in Vegas and we're fortunate to make sure i came to enjoy good food and service. I paid for all you can eat. But definitely worth the trip.",fake
"Wow. We ate here based on a recommendation in a guidebook, so we weren't sure what to expect. The menu made us wonder what we'd gotten ourselves into, as it just looks like a plastic, spiral-bound book of random sandwiches, burgers, and other dishes. The one sign that we were in for something good was the fact that the restaurant was packed on a Tuesday evening. I ordered the chicken marsala, and my friend ordered the chicken curry. After a longish wait (the slow service was our one complaint), we were presented with large plates of amazing food. Seriously, on the first bite, we were both stunned at how good our meals were - fresh, flavorful, and delicious. Unfortunately we were running a little late, so we had to eat fast, but I will definitely return the next time I'm in Montreal.",real
The staff is always friendly and the food is amazing. Portions are great and very healthy..,fake
Best place in the valley! Margaritas are great and the service is always great!,fake
"Best sushi in Phoenix, hands down.  The staff are super friendly without being dupuit.  The staff was also very friendly.  We tried their cookies that didn't mean that under $10.  I can't ever eat here egg sandwich. It is top quality and not over powering. The wings and baklava had a really good value. The place was clean and service was excellent as well.",fake

Thomas, the manager is such a peach, such a joy to have around, and if you're lucky enough to get Chad as your waiter, you're in for a treat. He's sweet, gorgeous, funny and treats you like royalty.Try: the hummus, and the Ceasar salad. Fabulous!",real
Ended up here earlier then we were satisfied.  Our server was awesome as always and the food was outstanding!  I would recommend this place to anyone.,fake

I love this place. Lettuce wraps are yummy but the chorizo is to die for.,fake
"I've always loved the food here. I went to a Baton Rouge years ago (different location) and I've always remembered how good their apps and mains were so I decided to try this location and it was just as good as I remembered it! We had the coconut shrimp and crab cakes as appetizers. DEFINITELY GET THE CRAB CAKES. Seriously, best crab cakes I've ever had.For mains, we got the BBQ pork back ribs with chicken tenders and the lobster sandwich. I recommend the pork back ribs; I found the chicken tenders and lobster sandwich to be just mediocre. Most importantly, the service was great. There were a lot of people in the restaurant because it was Sunday night but our waiter was still very upbeat and prompt and managed to handle many tables without a problem. When we left, I accidentally left my sunglasses there and one of the waitresses ran out to give it back to me.   Overall, loved the place and I would definitely go back. Baton Rouge remains one of my favourite restaurants.",real
"Five stars for a fast food chain?  Yes!  Cleanliness, friendliness, speed, efficiency, and food quality were all on point.  This is the first of 12 Habit Burger Grill's coming to the Valley.  They were somewhat busy when we stopped by for lunch today, but the line moved swiftly and the girl who took our was very sweet and proficient.  We had our receipt, drink cups, and our pager in less than a minute. Off we went to get drinks (Coke products, 3 different brewed iced tea choices, and strawberry lemonade), condiments, and some jalapeños from their pepper bar before sitting at a comfortable booth.  Our pager went off within a few minutes and we got to enjoy our delicious hot and fresh charburgers, sweet potato fries, and onion rings.  The charburger was juicy with a great flame broiled taste, the bun was light and fluffy, and the lettuce & tomato were fresh and crisp.The orders of onion rings and sweet potato fries were both generous in portion size.  We could have shared one order, but how can you try both that way!  The onion rings had a great crunch and a tasty batter.  They provided ranch with our rings if you like to dip.  The sweet potato fries were very good as well.  They were on the softer side which I liked (not fried to a crisp so you can't even tell they are sweet potatoes).  Next time I want to try the Tempura Green Beans, because they looked really good too!  The salads and grilled chicken sandwich are also on my future visits list.",real
Excellent food and service! The brussel sprouts and grouper are always delicious. Some of the best Italian food in the valley. The happy hour is a must :),fake
Best tacos I've had and have no complaints with this great place.,fake
The food never disappoints.  Everything is great!   The service is styling and they serve it fresh and hardworking. I'd recommend this place to anyone that likes little gelato.,fake

"I absolutely love this place. It's the heart of Mexican food with the beat of Pittsburgh. When you enter the restaurant you are greeted with a very pleasant welcome and photos on the wall with some of Pittsburgh's most familiar faces.I was with a large group of co workers. The table is greeted with complimentary chips and salsa that are absolutely delicious! We were serviced in a decent time. Fyi, I am a time fanatic when it comes to my food. I ordered a margarita on the rocks, and the chimichanga.Everything was absolutely delicious. And all of my co workers were thoroughly pleases with their drinks and meal. And you can't beat great service where the waiter seems enthusiastic and friendly.We also enjoyed celebrating with the other tables birthday festivities. This is a fun place to come to. I have been here before a couple years ago for Cinco de Mayo, and again it was such a great time but extremely busy. So beware if you plan to come on that day. But I promise you, that you will have a great time!",real
"Vegetarian friendly even though the online menu suggests otherwise. The miso soup and salad were great. I had the avocado roll, the vegan roll, and a third one (also vegetarian... can't remember).  Service was great. My only issue was that it was a bit pricy.",real
I am so upset about this I can't even express it. The curry chicken here was my favorite thing to eat to the point where I would consider it as a last meal. It was a red spicy curry sauce with garlic and ginger and chicken broth. I will miss it so much,real
Fantastic food and service. I always get the same thing out of Nauda's and it needs if that is my special treat!!!,fake

"Seriously amazing. This was my first time there and they gave me a ""tour"" which was actually a tour of 4 different sandwiches that they make. They were all phenomenal. I quickly changed my order of soup to the pastrami wrap. Their garlic aioli that they make in house is delicious. I want to buy a bottle of it! I have been trying to save my wrap and take a few bites of it throughout the afternoon to make it last because it is that good! I will definitely be back.",real

"Oh yeah! We absolutely love this place. It's always crowded and they pack tables and the bar very closely together. That part sucks as everyone has to squeeze to get by every where you go. For that reason I wouldn't sit at the bar.Compactness aside, their Sunday $10 brunch is what we always come here for. The food and a beer are included in that price? WHAT!I've had several things on their menu, all delicious, and with a practically free beer, I can see why this place is always full. We go here at least once a month and wish we could go more often. Highly recommend if you like brunch and beer... or a mimosa which is also available in their $10 brunch deal.",real
Great food and great service! It is the best pizza in the city. Love the wings which are always perfectly cooked n good. I haven't tried their donuts and this place is highly recommended.

"The food is enough to give Kaya 5 stars, but add in the excellent service and you're talking about a whole other level. The atmosphere/vibe is chill and feels fancy without being super formal. Try the Rainbow Salad and you won't be disappointed!!",real
"Very good quality food and very delicious. Very friendly service, will come again. I like that they take your cell phone number down instead of a pager. This gives me a chance to walk around while I wait.",real
"Quite possibly the best meal I have ever eaten. Ordered the crab cake dinner; better than any crab cake I've eaten in Maryland! Our waiter Jackson was so fun, and made our evening!",real
I really loved this place. There are so many ways to customize a taco here that I can't see how it would get old. The best part is the hard shell taco inside the soft shell and you won't leave here still hungry or broke like some other trendy spots. I will definitely be back,real
"Amazing food, amazing service, amazing atmosphere, downtown Las Vegas is truly stepping up their game and quality.  Only downside was the time it took to be seated, but it was well worth the wait.",real

"One of my favorite haunts! Located in the industrial park around Warm Springs And American Pacific. Parking is easy and the spot it great. Now to the beer...I'm a beer snob and Crafthaus does a rally nice job for a younger local beer company. I'm from San Diego so I set the bar high...Stone, Green Flash, Ale Smith, etc. Great prices for flights, pints and growlers. The bartenders are knowledgeable and friendly. They do some great collaboration beers too. The Jean-Claude is an amazing Belgium/Abby style beer. So good! Only beef is they don't have it year round . Heir coffee stout is solid as is their strong IPA. Not a big Sour fan but their Table Sour Beer is nice too. Love this place!",real
Food is filling and delicious. The quality of the ingredients are also really good with generous portions and excellent customer service make this place a must go<ing>,fake
This place is great. The pizza is always fresh and served in a fair price. The only downside is getting a small spot in Scottsdale.,fake
"I agree with Hannah: Blue Sky is the greasy-spoon of all greasy-spoons.  Perfect for just about any moment, but heavenly when you're drunk or hungover (perhaps that's why they call it Blue Sky).  I love coming back here when we visit Amherst, it's always a good time and the waitresses are amazingly tolerant of late night drunkards. The breakfast sandwich is to die for and the bomb is exactly that- it will wreck you. But you'll love every minute of it. They will definitely be seeing me again!",real
"Delicious. I have been craving the garlic chicken all week. It was so good, I need to tell everyone that I know that they have to go and eat some of the garlic chicken that changed my life.Ok, not really changed my life, but made me sad that I don't live closer to enjoy the yummy dishes that are offered at this friendly shop. I ordered the $5 Bento: rice, couple pieces of kim chee, spam and garlic chicken. Crispy, juicy, salty and sweet. Oh my, what a combination. It was the perfect size for my smaller appetite ( I also needed to save room for gelato).My husband had a bigger plate that included ahi, chicken, rice, fried saimin and spam. He ate all of his food-cleaned his plate! I am picky about my rice, I like it cooked a certain way, I call it fatsy... super sticky without being mushy. If a place serves rice that is no where near my fatsy scale, it is immediately on my SL. This place serves rice that is perfect. I could have just eaten rice and been happy. While we were eating, a lady came by to talk to us about our food. I love service like this, it lets the customer know that the people that are serving the food really want to know if you enjoy what you are eating and makes you feel like you are more than just a customer. It sends a message to the patron that the business cares.Enjoy, the garlic chicken!",real
"We had a chance to check out this place when our family came to Vegas for Rise festival. I was so impressed with this place cuz its decoration and the food. Their service is supper friendly and attentive. We ordered a lot of different dishes and shared with each other. I'm Vietnamese, and I rarely eat American food. But their food is the BOMB. I think there a combination of Vietnamese style in their American food. That's why I enjoyed all dishes we ordered!!!My favorite are chicken wings with fish sauce and banh mi belly pork. It was too damn good! I would say I was addicted to chicken wings and ordered extra one to eat at the hotel :)Fiends, if you are in Vegas, come and check out this place. You will love it. FOR SURE!!!",real
"One of the best restaurant experiences I have had in a really long time. The place is unassuming from the outside tucked away in a strip mall, but I assure you if you give it a shot you will not be disappointed. To start out the service was great. Our server was the best we have had in a really long time. Very friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. Also very passionate about the restaurant as well as the rest of the staff. Not sure if it is family owned or not but is has that feel. Had live music which we all enjoyed. A very unexpected surprise. The food itself was amazing. We ordered garlic knots and drunkbread and both disappeared almost instantly. I had shrimp and garlic ravioli that tasted fresh, homemade, and super delicious. The complimentary bread with oil and vinegar was a great side to pair with ravioli, and also great to sop up the rest of that creamy sauce with. Friends had the chicken and veal parmesan, both of which were equally happy with their selections. I tasted both and their dishes and liked them a lot as well. Their marinara was really fresh and flavorful. To finish the meal I ordered the tiramisu and was not disappointed. The ladyfingers were moist but not mushy nor hard on the inside, just perfectly spongey as another reviewer posted (and my reason for prdering this in the first place over my goto cannoli).  That was a great finish to an even better meal. We all thoroughly enjoyed our food and overall experience at Mieles and would recommend it again. Great food, amazing staff/owners, and overall great experience. Moving to this area soon and checking out the local spots and happy to say we found a gem. We will be back again soon!",real
Awesome place. I loved their food and the drinks are to die for!!! I would highly recommend this place to anyone.,real
Great food and service.    Had the Chicken Teriyaki beef and I loved the haggis tacos. The chef was very helpful and personable. We will be returning!!,fake

Great sushi. No complaints. Good types of coffee. The crab cake sui is a must.  Delicious and great prices.  I wish I had to stop by so having a huge selena while you wait for your phone.

The chicken Katsu was great! I can't say enough good things about this place. I'm on this side of town and want the hunt for me soon.  So good.  Every employee was very pleasant and knowleggeable.  We enjoyed both ramen and burgers and the chicken are a great way to start the day or weekend.,fake

"I usually don't wright these but after my experience here last night I felt it necessary. My husband wanted The Yard House for his birthday dinner so we came with a party of 12. I had tried to call in advance and make reservations but they had already been booked so the host recommended to me over the phone that I should show up 30-40 min early myself so that by the time my party got there I would already have our spot and they all wouldn't have to wait. This is exactly what I did. However, the wait was much longer than expected. Apparently the table that they wanted to sit our larger party had one table in the middle of guests who just were not leaving which was making it impossible for them to have our table ready. I ended up waiting way longer than I was told and as our guests arrived they waited too. The manager working at the time (I'm upset I didn't get his name because he deserves some recognition) was so caring and apologetic and I could tell he wasn't just saying things because he had to but because he really wanted to help us out. He explained the table situation and thanked us for our patience and asked if we wanted to continue waiting, I told him we would wait longer. What I appreciated most was he then went out of his way to say ""well let me do something for you guys because I appreciate your patience"" and he bought our whole party a round of drinks from the bar while we waited! I thought this was amazing customer service given nobody from our party had complained or been upset with him yet he still felt it necessary to go out of his way and do something nice for us. I thought that was AWESOME! After getting our drinks we only waited about 5 more minutes and were then seated. Once being seated the service was also awesome! Everybody is so friendly and on top of thing. I never had to ask to have my drink refilled , never had to remind them when we asked for something which was impressive when you have a large party like we did. The food was amazing and the menu offers such a selection of different types of foods it has something for whatever you're in the mood for. Besides waiting so long (which was a big part my fault I shouldve tried to book reservations sooner) this place was awesome and I feel like they went above and beyond to keep my party happy. Will definitley be returning!",real
Friendly staff and great food! Always a pleasure to dine in and have some food to sware and great service. My favorite part is the dessert: Chicken fried steak. It's huge and do it! I always come here when the inside is not the most friendly owner. Not for bad service but their plates are huge!,fake

My favorite dim sum place. The prices are great and the price is right too. Even the wait is always so busy but worth it I would recommend to everyone that likes lobster roll.,fake
I don't know why this place lived in the strip but worth every penny. Place is clean and the owner was very friendly!,fake

"First impressions are most important right? Exploring the neighborhood, I'd already looked at the online menu. It took me a couple of turns before I eventually visited. Why? I'm not sure. Again....I work in the area and love to explore new places. When appropriate, I'll recommend a place to go.I wandered in for lunch, and ordered take out. Prompt, friendly greeting.Decided upon the patty melt and for a dollar more some O-rings.WoW!!    Yum!   Literally one of the best Patty Melts I've had. EVER!! And the Rings!! Yum!!The Rye was grilled perfectly. The onions were nice and crisp, sweet and perfectly cooked, melty cheese and a perfectly cooked medium well burger. Juicy and nicely charred. The onion rings were panko crusted I believe but tender on the inside, minced sweet onion and oh so good.An eclectic place, it was a diner with a modern vibe. I struck up a conversation with some 'regulars' while I was waiting. They were very charming. The server and counter staff were very friendly.Highly recommend!!",real
Last night I am so happy they're expecting time at the door and they'll run out of food you get alone. My favorite dish is the burnt ends. Staff is always friendly and attentive.,fake

If you are not familiar with Ethiopian cuisine, prepare yourself for a cultural experience!  Finish off your meal with a cup or two if the Yirgacheffe coffee.",real
High quality tacos - low prices. Fell in love with their cauliflower taco and mango habanero salsa. {spicy & delish}. Will be back for many more tacos and Patrick Sullivan's company.,real
Found this gem while on my Restaurant.com app. So happy I did! My husband and I walked in and were immediately impressed with the atmosphere. The inside looks like a scene from Breakfast at Tiffany's. The mint infused tea and lemonade were delicious and our server was very attentive but seemed very shy and unsure of the menu. My husband ordered the hulk dish which was a chicken sandwich with avocado and his meal was very good but my cauliflower soup fell a little short. Once I added cheese and a dash of salt and pepper it was much more satisfying. The owner was also very sweet and involved in how our experience was going; even offered some meal suggestions. We will be returning very soon for brunch as I am excited to try more of their dishes and their famous bacon jam!,real
"Chef Giuseppe knows us, we are regulars. He suggested two meals that were simply amazing! My husband had Sole served table-side by Giuseppe and I had lobster on fresh pasta of the day. The salad course he suggested was the roasted red and yellow beet salad on fresh greens with goat cheese and candied walnuts. Layered full flavors, paired expertly, for a wonderful experience. I noticed he greeted each guest and escorted them to their table. It was thrilling to see someone with such passion for what he does, taking personal care of customers.",real

"If you are looking for something special, this is definitely it.  I went for my birthday with my sister. We wore our classy, cocktail dresses so our attire was perfect.  The meals were light, french and very tasteful.  I absolutely loved the bread and dessert cart.  For females, I would recommend the 2 selection course since you can have a few servings of bread and mini desserts at the end.   I would go back.  I would not recommend parties greater than 4.  I highly recommend just a party of 2.",real
"Drove all the way from Phoenix to Tempe to try this place and we were not disappointed. We got the Pomegranate Sparkling, The Special Galaxy , and the Blue Angel.

"UPDATE: I have gone three times now. I have bumped the original 4 stars to 5 now. I went again last nite for the 3rd time, mainly bc I got the night off and they added a new salad I needed to have in this heat! So, I went at the end of HH and had a few oysters and their house cocktail, The Sunburn. Perfect for the heat! Followed up with the new Heirloom Tomato, Watermelon, and Burrata salad. Then the Hanger Steak. The salad was everything I was looking for! A perfect blend of flavors and freshness! It was bright and fresh and the burrata added the cream aspect! I would go back today to do it again! Steak wise.... yes, yes, yes. It was perfectly cooked and the potatoes and summer corn were amazing! This subtle coconut cream with cilantro were just perfect.  I am so happy to have this place so close to my home! Thank you Chef Jamie! Thank you Andrew Hooper! Being that I went on the first nite open, I can't give it 5 stars yet, however, I have nothing but good to say! First, the setting itself is welcoming and comfortable and upscale, while still being non pretentious and welcoming to the neighbors. I love the decor and color scheme! I stared at the bar for happy hour, while waiting for my friend to join for dinner. I had a $3 craft beer and a half a dozen fresh oysters! I chose 3 with mignonette and 3 with their lemongrass ""sauce"". I'm glad I let the bartender convince me to order the lemongrass ones, bc they were even better than the classic ones! Once my friend arrived, we got a table and moved to the dining room. We hadn't intended to eat an entire meal so we ordered the tuna tartare, hamachi crudo, house pickles, and the green salad. Every bit of each of these dishes was fabulous. Great flavors all around. I could eat a few orders of that tartare! We needed up ordering the slow cooked short rib, on the server Riches recommendation. SO glad I we did! I never would have ordered that without prompting and it was great! The gnocchi was yucca based and so tasty. We rode ed a couple glasses off their happy hour, followed by an Amazingly priced Planta Cerasiolo DI Vittoria. What a great dining experience! Everyone from the owners who greeted me, to the bartender, to our server Rich, gave us such genuine friendly service. Chef Tran even came out to talk to us after our meal! I will most definitely be coming here again, most likely making it my after work spot for a great meal and great drinks! Can't wait!",real
"I LOVE this restaurant.  I tried it once and now I have breakfast there once a week.  Not only is the food great, but the orders are reasonable.  Single stack french toast to go with my bacon and eggs? FINALLY!!! Whoever made the menu ""gets it"".  Sometimes you want french toast or pancakes but you don't want ONLY that as your meal.  Brandon, one of the servers, really ties that place together.  I'll keep going back.  Show up early!  The seats go quick on the weekends.",real
"Another amazing restaurant at Aria. Went there for dinner 2 times, both times our steak was perfectly cooked! And their oysters are delicious",real

"Vivo is not you typical Italian restaurant where you go and sit and eat for hours.  Its not quite fancy and its not quite a dive.  I like to call it an Italian diner 5 start restaurant food but not quite 5 star ambiance.  I give 5 starts to the food, service and the whole Vivo concept.  Menu it not too large but covers all your Italian needs.  Every section on the menu is the same price.  Example all Apps are the same price, all pastas are the same price etc...  I was looking for a good Sunday lunch but wasn't willing to get all dressed up an wanted to be super casual.  Vivo is super casual but with top notch real authentic Italian food.  We ordered the fried Calamari and Shrimp to start they were cooked perfectly taste was there we all know fried fish kind of always tastes the same lol.  I then had a pate of Penne a la Vodka.  Sauce was amazing penne were cooked eldente, just the right amount of pancetta.  Portion was also perfect.  Whats an Italian meal with out having a piece of tiramisu and a coffee.  Tiramisu was very good.  All and all this felt like a typical Sunday Italian family lunch.  There are still many items to be tried on the menu so Vivo here i come lol.",real
One of the best in the West Island.  Great food and atmosphere.  The chicken fried steak and the Toro tort are both great.  They let you sample anything with the fast style.,fake

Hands down my favorite pizza spot in Arizona. The margherita pizza is phenomenal. The whole basil leaves are a nice touch. I use to work right next door so we ordered from here frequently. Here are some items I suggest:-Meatballs-Margherita Pizza (any pizza really)-Tuna MeltThe ambiance is pretty neat at night. It's homey and cozy. One of my co-workers actually proposed to his wife here! Haven't had a chance to try the drinks yet but I hear they do a good job!,real
Great food & even better service!!!!! Eric was cheerful & started our day with laughs!!,real
"Love this place! Very friendly environment and good food!  They have a ton of food and flavor and is great.  Not a place to go for pho in a steakhouse or I recommend the brisket sandwich and the squash ball in their peanut butter and matcha salsa to die for. The sushi chefs and servers are great and knowledgable.  They were all set up with a smile and accommodating and taking orders care and make you feel welcome. It's a pleasure to see something with way they end up sharing that you'll be surprised by how little too salty the party is since they don't care, they always bring the option for drink connoisseur. I dream about the drink and enjoy their food just assuress why the donut shop is not too bad on the way to open up.",fake
The food here is amazing! It's a small place and the food is really good and they have great food. Love the salsa bar as well.,fake
"Loved this gem of a restaurant.  The staff was wonderful, the food delicious and ambiance just right for a Sunday brunch.  First I do not speak French.  The menu is written in French but not to worry because the servers will help you decipher the daily specials and make recommendations as well.   Just ask and they will be happy to speak what English they can to assist you!  That said I ordered a heuvos rancheros, which they tweaked it so that it was Vegetarian.  If you see something you like and it has meat in it not to worry because most items can be arranged so that they are Vegetarian friendly...again just ask.When my brunch arrived it was exactly what I was hoping for...a creative take on the dish!  I love when a chef adds his/her creativity to an item to make it unique.  The food was well prepared (the potato could have been a little less cooked but I didn't mind it as it was), the sauces that were provided alongside the dish were delicious (not sure what the Yellow sauce was but it was my favorite, the habenero sauce is good but it IS hot, and the green sauce was nice but I like spicy, flavorful sauces), and the servers were lovely!  I truly appreciate when Quebecers attempt to speak to me in English when it is clearly not easy for them and I do realize my French is completely atrocious in comparison.   Hospitality is making someone else feel comfortable and that is exactly what their staff did!  They were very hospitable and if I was in Montreal in the future this restaurant would reside on my go-to list.",real
"First time visiting this place and won't disappoint. The food was amazing. Kim was great, and friendly and knowledgeable, welcoming. Staff was great. Had the chicken fingers, wonton soup and both were great. Wish they were open a little longer than other places but worth the wait.  The service was great as well!!!",fake
Went to Tempe location for lunch.   The food was too.  The best flavors and tastes in LA was like in the & Grand Canalita multiple times. The staff is always so nice & helpful.

I love the Aladdin's dressing--it's mostly olive oil and lemony.This time we got dessert which was so, so good.  Neapolitan cheesecake for me and peanut butter mousse cake for the hubby although we ended up sharing...both were awesome! Extra stars!  :D",real
"Consistently delicious and crazy cheap. Amazing tortillas, chorizo burritos, tacos, machaca and tostados. Don't be deterred by the shabby exterior. Be cautious in evenings though...I was once accosted by a smelly derelict demanding money on the way in who was laying across my car when I left... I was pleasantly surprised when I went back into the establishment and two kitchen employees promptly jumped the counter and scared him off. Still doesn't stop me from coming back! It's worth it...",real

"I never thought I'd be ordering dumplings at a restaurant (too used to frozen dumplings as my student-budget meals), but this place has the BEST dumplings, and it's at an incredible value! Apparently they increased the price, but whatever... I'm already an addict.So here it is. $5.99 for 15 dumplings (some variants may cost you a little more). Dumplings are all handmade and steamed to order. My favourites are Pork & Fennel (it's actually dill), Pork & Leek and the Lamb ($7.99).All the dumplings are SO juicy and flavourful. I find myself craving these multiple times in a week. And at this value... Why not?!Yes, all I order here are dumplings (why waste precious stomach space for anything else?), but if you want to try something else, their Deep Fried Green Onion Fritter/Pancake (might be called something else on the menu) is super yum too.",real
"Liege waffles with bischoff sauce, mmmmmm You know those airline cookies you get? The Bischoff? They turned it into a sauce!  Its the exact same flavor!  THe waffles are not your normal waffles, they are more a dough than a batter, so they have a lot more substance to them than waffles we typically get. And everything comes direct from Belgium.The service was also excellent!  Prompt and extremely nice.  If you get there and there's a line, be ready to wait a bit to get your food since there is only one person but it is well worth the wait!",real

Excellent! The lemonade is made with fresh mint blended into it and it is amazing. The vegetarian combo was also exceptional; lots of food and tasty. Here's the kicker: my dad had schnitzel!

When i have friends in from out of town, their sunday brunch is my favorite place to show off what fun it is to live around here.",real
"A great find that is real, modern and relaxed. It is out of the slot-machine ugliness that characterizes Las Vegas. The food is creative and tasty- a real foodie place without the high prices. Nice staff and servers who are authentically friendly. The atmosphere is bright and airy in a warehouse setting.",real
"The BEST damn Shanghai noodles in the city, the broth was so tasty. Service was good.",fake
My family and I enjoyed breakfast here the apps and french toast were excellent. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive. We will be back again when I come back to Vegas!!!,fake
Great service as usual food excellent. Only wish they were open later though however I was really impressed. Great atmosphere and great variety. Our waitress was friendly and helpful. Very friendly and I luckily we will be coming back!,fake
"What can I not say about this place?! My boyfriend and I were staying a block away for a weekend trip. It was our place to go for a ""nightcap"".  Lo-and-behold it was one of the coolest bars we've ever experienced and we are both bartenders. The bartenders/cocktail servers/host(ess) were so hospitable and lovely. Be sure to catch the ""fire show"" late night. We are telling EVERYONE about Le Lab. Best bar we've experienced in a really long time! Do yourself a favor and go! And they also gave the BEST recommendations for local restaurants/eateries. Darwin will keep you safe if a drunkard is hitting on you as well! Much love to all of the staff of Le Lab!  Miss you already!!",real
My husband and I went there this past weekend. The food was amazing. We will definitely be going back when I'm not pregnant to enjoy some of their margaritas!!,real
"On Saturday I had brunch here at the Flying Fig and I have to say it was fabulous.I had planned to take my out of town guest to hit a regular fav restaurant in the area for lunch but my friend really wanted breakfast and saw the Fig's sign for brunch.  I had dinner here when they first opened and my memory from years ago was that it was overpriced and not so great but thank goodness for second chances. We sat inside since the tables outside were full as it was a gorgeous day.  It was tricky getting seated inside as they had  no one greeting guests and the staff at seemed indifferent.  Once seated we had great service even with someone new to the staff who was in training.  The coffee was excellent and was provided with a lovely side service tray of including raw sugar, sweeter and creamer brought with my coffee.  Next came fresh bread with butter and homemade blueberry preserves.  A great start to what only got better,  my meal was sooo good!  I had the migas which was local eggs scrambled with tortillas, peppers, scallions, roasted chili, aged cheddar, tomatillo cilantro salsa and crème fraiche served with the most perfectly seasoned, roasted fingerling potatoes.  The layers of flavors was perfect and my taste buds savored every bite.  My friend had the omelette of the day with which looked awesome and she proclaimed as the fluffiest, best omelette ever.  I personally rarely order an omelette because i really hate a ""browned"" omelet which I find overcooked and tough.  Next time I may get the omelette after seeing her breakfast.  Oh wait, I forgot I planned to get the creamy polenta with tallegio cheese, local greens & Killbuck Farm mushrooms and a crispy poached egg.   But then it again it might be that I'd have the whole wheat Ohio blueberry & banana pancakes (choice of sausage or bacon) and Snake Hill Farms maple syrup.  Ah, so many great choices but it could be hard for me to pass up the migas again.Here's my advice, make plans to go support the West Side Market merchants and get your week's groceries  -- and enjoy a great brunch supporting this local Ohio City restaurant.  Enjoy!",real
Fantastic food. Fantastic service. Thanks for making our evening fantastic. We'll be back for sure!,real
"Ok...I admit  I was  extremely  apprehensive going to some place claiming to have real Texas bbq. Since I moved to Arizona 2 years ago, I have yet to find a decent  bbq place. It has almost  become  a challenge. But I'm  biased  because  I grew up in Texas  and have particularly  high standards. My husband  says it's just being picky. However, I LOVE this place! I will  never again  go anywhere  else!! Prices are reasonable, staff is incredibly  attentive and checked on us several  times, food was amazing. My husband got The Brian and they didn't  skimp on anything. My brisket  sandwich was overflowing and could've  been  split. Their corn soufflé was just like my Gran made. They don't  coat their meat  in disgusting  bbq sauce, unlike  most places  out here. Don't  let the appearance  fool you. It may be  a hole in the wall. But the best places usually  are.",real
"This place has the absolute best falafel in town! It's affordable, delicious, and just a quaint little place that's a nice escape from the usual bustle of Mill Avenue.  I actually decided to come here for my birthday lunch because it's one of the best restaurants out there!",real
Awesome service and most importantly the sophisticated wait staff. Will definitely be back,fake
"My boyfriend and I found this place simply because it was most convenient during our stay in Montreal. We walked in 5 minutes before their official lunch specials were ending, and the staff was kind enough to inform us - they worked with us to get our orders into the kitchen on time. We were impressed by the ambiance of the restaurant - the room was filled with sophisticated businessmen and locals, a classy vibe with people looking to chat over a good meal.I ordered the Teriyaki Sirloin with Sweet Potato Fries and was completely satisfied - cooked exactly how I asked, and one of the best steaks I've had in a while. My boyfriend ordered the Prime Rib with French Fries and nearly cleaned his plate. We were also served a delicious loaf of bread and enjoyed our reasonably priced drinks.Overall, amazing service, amazing food, and amazing ambiance. Although a bit on the pricey side for two college students, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone stopping through Montreal and looking for a good steak meal. Worth it.",real
"For an all you can eat this place is great, never dissapointed here. Good selection and fresh sea food.",real

This is a great place for excellent brisket! The sauce is just spicy enough! This is the only place our family eats BBQ!,real
"Yum!! Let me say that I'm only giving a 4 star review because I haven't tried enough of the menu to make it 5. But I WILL! Today I went in there hangry,  so I stuck to basics - doubles and my son had the boneless chicken roti. Fresh, delicious, not too greasy (like some doubles can be) and the perfect amount of spice. I can't wait to go back to try the shrimp doubles and some of the specials. Very friendly service (the owner was very nice to my teenaged son), clean, comfortable decor. We ate in, which we wouldn't have if the decor hadn't been so welcoming. They seem very busy, which is a good sign! I'd been meaning to give the place a try, and I'm very glad I did! We will be back!",real
"Best Chinese food I've found here... they accommodate special requests like brown sauce on my chicken and broccoli like they make on the east coast/midwest. Fried shrimp, crab puffs and egg so soup are YUMMY!!! Also love the sweet and sour chicken. .. crispy and all white meat.",real
Wow. The food and the owners are so fun and did I mention the prices are high just like what I ate. My friend always end up going anytime for us to check out their open space with the quality of food.   Highly recommended!!,fake
Delicious! Got a flight of the local brew and the beef brisket. Nice atmosphere.  Good service,real
"I used to only eat seafood so, the Tuna Melt from Earl's was my go-to. Now that I have stepped back into the carnivorous lifestyle, The Original has taken the #1 spot. It's warm, the bread is crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, the meat to cheese to bread ratio is perfection. I love that this place is open 24/7 and the prices are super affordable after a long night of partying and expensive bar tabs. I have to go here at least once anytime I visit LV. A must!",real
"I live right on Pecos and Sunset so it's hardly a mile from my house. Never had time or the motivation to go in, until I read all the great reviews. Being a college student that just came back from Cali for Winter Break it's a little pricey, but once in a while it's a great treat. The environment is relaxing. The music was unique and a bookshelf with a variety of random books, ranging from textbooks (I think) to video game strategy-guide books. It's really very quiet besides the occasional customer that comes in to talk. The owners/baristas are very friendly and knowledgeable. He remembered I came in a couple days earlier and I had lost my card that day, so he gave me two stamps. I got a soy-chai latte with a shot of espresso (Dirty Chai). It was spicy and flavorful. At first thought they might have added too much...but after the initial taste, it was amazing. I took my vegan friends and one got some kind of burrito, they called it the alien burrito, that looked delicious. Coffee kin rejoice. A quaint, stylish coffee shop that in the future I would love to bring friends to. Good job and thanks for the extra stamp!",real
"First time here even though I used to frequent Vegas quite a bit. I got to say the entire experience here was magnificent. We got there early and had some time to hang out at the bar. The bartenders were quite attentive and talkative. Great times at the bar. The hostess found us at the bar and escorted us to our seats. Our waiter was great and made our time at Del Frisco's fun. Thanks Joey. From your input on the food, wine, and history of the restaurant we had the best time.The food was amazing. We had ordered the crab cakes, double eagle prime, spinach, and mac n cheese. If you order the crab cakes, I would recommend that you order your own. You probably won't want to share. The double eagle prime was cooked to perfection. I love ordering a medium rare and having it just melt in your mouth. This did just that. The meat was so flavorful and tender. The sides that we ordered were good too but not something I absolutely have to have. I would be content with just the crab cake and steak.Definitely worth checking out!",real
Had a wonderful dinner here at the bar. Food was delicious and our waiter she was amazing! We will be back soon! People were friendly and made our time here!,fake
Went here for the Bloody Mary bar but the breakfast itself was delicious!! This is such a good choice for breakfast/brunch in Vegas that isn't a buffet.  I got the special of the day which was lemon crepes with blueberries and homemade whipped cream.  Will definitely be back here!,real
The best wings I have ever eaten.  FIrst time visit with a group of co-workers.  Owner brought us samples which were awesome.  Ended up eating there twice just to make sure the first time wasn't a fluke.  I would  go out of my way to get back there and eat again.,real

This place is soooo good! if you're looking for a great dining experience this is a must try!,fake
"I had the slow-roasted beef sandwich or whatever they call the Bahn Mi. It was unbelievable. Also, I am a little curious about why some of the other reviewers found the service lacking. It was impeccable during my visit. I have only had one thing on the menu, but I will make it a practice to go eat here once a week because it was far better than anything I have had in this area for lunch. If the people at the restaurant read these things, the only thing I would suggest is to move the teas somewhere more convenient. It is weird to fill up your tea right where people are entering to order. This might be a spacing issue, and again, not a deal-breaker for me.",real

"Expensive but most places in Toronto is.Sushi was tasty. Service was great. They explained everything and how they cook/prep everything. They don't serve rolls with soy sauce as they infuse sauce and flavor into them but we still needed sauce and wasabi. Nice that it's in a building with a ramp. Big restaurant, fancy. Luckily we dressed up as everyone was dressy there.",real
We ate there in December and attended their holiday Dinner Theater.  It was delightful and the food fantastic!  It is a great place!,real
"Not our typical place we would go to, but we had to meet some friends here and they were late, so we decided to check it out based on a sign we saw for Happy Hour.It was dimly lit and basically seat yourself, so we found a booth near the back. The waitress came over and I complimented her on her outfit ( schoolgirl plaid skirt and top ) she was quite friendly. They had 2$ well drinks on special, so I ordered a gin & pineapple. We also ordered nachos and chicken wings which were only 5$ each during Happy Hour. The food arrived fairly quickly, and we were really impressed with it for the price. It was so good ! We had a few more drinks and then got the bill. It was under 25$ for everything. One of the least expensive meals, and one of the better tasting ones. I guess when you go in with low expectations, you can be pleasantly surprised.",real

"This place is a Cleveland classic. This spot offers THE most bang for your buck. Prices are low, atmosphere is authentic. The St.Louis ribs and Santorini wings are where it's at, meaty, original rub, and they make all of their own sauces. They also have great beer specials and taps. We have our family party every year in the Argus room, the owner is very accommodating and nice. The menu has a classic diner feel, but also has items such as an unbeatable deal for the Friday Fish-Fry. The Tick Tock will always be a big, wonderful piece of Cleveland to me.",real

"I absolutely loved this place!  The food is absolutely divine and the addition of the chimmi-churri sauces made everything better. My friend and I both ordered the Parilloda Mixta which consists of the chicken, chorizo, and NY Strip. We also ordered a small plate of grilled shrimp, yellow rice and roasted potatoes. My steak was well done and the chicken with the green chimmi sauce made it more flavorful. The sausage was a little salty for me but the next day I finished the rest and weirdly it was perfect. I wish we would've remembered to bring a bottle of wine since its BYOB. There was not as much seating as I would have liked upstairs but we managed to snag a table as a couple got up to leave. The menu was a little confusing at first but I just hopped on yelp and the pictures on here helped us out tremendously. We were both extremely satisfied and we will definitely return. Our meals were worth every penny.",real
OMG this place is the bomb the only thing I don't like is that I would move to the neighborhood.,fake

The last time we ordered they forgot our sodas and they called us to confirm that we received them. We didn't mind so we didn't bother telling them. This time they brought us the extra sodas in addition to our order. We weren't expecting it. It was above and beyond great customer service.",real
Excellent food and service. Service was great. Restaurant was packed.,fake
"Top notch food, service and maybe the best pizza place in AZ.  Saw this place on triple D and went to try it out.  We tried the caprese which rocked with homemade mozzarella, ordered a couple pizzas (stallion and Margherita)  and salads with a few beers!  Since its so good, expect it to be busy and surprised when its not busy, then you  plan for some slow service (hang out and talk with your dinner party for a change) due to the mass of pizza zombies waiting to whet their hunger with lovely wood fired pizza!Will be back for sure!!!!!!!!",real

"Warning: this review is going to be positively glowing. If you're not in it for the long-haul, I understand. Try this place. Try the lemonade, try the turkish coffee, try the tabbouleh, try the falafel. If you don't mind a longer review read on: The owner, Isam,  couldn't have been more friendly, informative, generous or helpful. When he found out it was my first time at the restaurant he insisted that I try the lemonade, baklava and turkish coffee (I completely agreed) and then  *bam* he insisted that they were on the house. I was not expecting such a generous offer and I was more than happy to pay for these items myself, Isam's pride of ownership is genuinely impressive. He seems to run his business from an old-school model based on integrity, a little showmanship, and a product that truly sells itself.  I proceeded to order, Lebanese chicken and grape leaves and wait for my food. They brought my lemonade, and to be honest, I really had no idea what could have possibly been so wonderful about lemonade that I would just HAVE to try it. Well, I have three simple answers rose water, orange blossom, and honey. They don't put any sugar in their lemonade, it has this beautiful delicate floral taste, anchored by a richness from the honey. You will love it. The lebanese chicken and grape leaves were ahhmazing. The tabbouleh is incredible and balanced to perfection. Not too much of this, or that...just right. The owner tells me that they go through about five batches per day. I believed him. Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli was so delicious, I began snapping pictures of my food and plotting my yelp review while still in the restaurant. I began bragging via text to all of my foodie friends. I took a to-go order for friends I was meeting up with later, it seemed like a nice gesture, but really I just wanted to have an excuse to try more of their delicious fare. Per Isam's insistence, he brought a piece of baklava and turkish coffee. The baklava was delicious. The shining star was the turkish coffee. My god. Best. Coffee. Ever. Seriously. If nothing else, go here and order lemonade and turkish coffee. You will be thrilled. If I don't eat at this place at least once a week as long as I live in Phoenix I'm going to be disappointed. I can't wait to go back. Upon leaving the restaurant I noticed a new gyro place had opened two doors down. I actually felt sorry for them, their business is probably going to tank by proxy.",real
This place was the bomb.com this was the ice cream shop for a IP. It's super busy and the staff is so friendly. I would definitely go there again and again,fake

"I almost felt underdressed walking into the Mesa location of one of my very favorite eateries. Being used the to hot, crowded, loud Tempe location, hubski and I showed up in our jeans and ratty we-were-thinking-about-going-to-bed-but-decided-to-go-Cornish-style-instead shirts.In this location, the owners had a little- ok a lot- more space to be creative. The seats are church pews. There are candles in wine bottles. I won't ruin everything for you, but just look closely at the tables.Although the space is larger, the decor helps to maintain the cozy comfortable quality we love about Cornish-Tempe.I ordered the Spicy Asiago Chicken- veggie style. Hubski got the veggie tikka masala. They were both delicious, as always. We went back with a friend a couple of nights later and ordered the caramel apple pasty and the banoffee pie. They were out of bananas so they substituted strawberries. It was tasty, but bananas really belong to that confection. The apple caramel pasty was PMS-licious!We love this place and we'll be back soon... maybe tonight!Oh- and a shoutout to Lindsay B.- no trans fats in sight!",real
Awesome local spot! The brisket is really good! Others have mentioned chocolate Chip wings that are pretty good and fries are incredible!  The only downside is that it's a little fun just off strip shop,fake
"5 stars all-around.  The BBQ pork / jalapeno pizza I'm telling you was so darn good.  The ""slingers"" are awesome, fried cheese and bacon bit egg rolls with raunch dipping sauce.  I mean it allowed me to drink like 4 more glasses.  AWESOME.  The beers were awesome.  1 of 3 days I was there I got some warm beer shooters on the sampler paddle, and then they hit me up with a $2.00 surcharge for ""gravy"" for the enchiladas.  I mean that is just retarded and I pointed out the half-a-grand we spent with clients over 3 days so they removed the beer sampler.  So I gotta follow-thru on 5 stars.  As a former waiter / bartender in college I am real pragmatic.  And this place makes it obvious why they had a line at 8:30 p.m. Friday and the Pubic House nearby wasn't.  GREAT WORK.  Dynamite.  Great job.  Impeccable service.",real

Fresh pasta, fresh cheeses and fruits, if I had a bigger appetite I would have ordered one of their pizzas because they looked delicious.I am giving them 5 stars because I would definitely take family there and recommend to friends.",real

"We happened to be in the area and decided to try Kanda Izakaya. I must say we had a pleasant experience. The servers were attentive and friendly. We ordered 3 dishes: shoyu ramen, salmon oshizushi and spicy scallop roll. We both got complimentary miso soup and salad which was very nice. We didn't get charged for green tea which is a pet peeve of mine. Food arrived quickly. As frequent ramen eaters, we were quite surprised at the quality of the ramen for an izakaya. I wouldn't expect the ramen to be as good as specialized ramen shops but it was just what we needed on a cold day! The flavour on the salmon oshizushi (pressed sushi) was delicious. I thought the rice to fish ratio was good. Spicy scallop roll had scallop, crab and some tempura pieces. Not really what I expected but tasted great. Overall, we had a great dining experience and wouldn't hesitate to come back. As picky Japanese food eater, it's a thumbs from from me!",real

I saw the reviews so I decided to check it out. I got the italian beef and it was great. The sandwich was packed with beef. This was one of the best beef sandwiches that I have had. I got it to go and had the au jus on the side which let the sandwich travel well. I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu. the staff was friendly and the wait time was pretty quick.,real
"I come here once or twice every time I go to Vegas. I switch off between the Earl's Club and the Italian. I always get a tomato soup because they put croutons in it and it tastes like magic. I usually take a bite of the sandwich and then drink a spoonful of the soup. If no one's looking, I use my sandwich as a spoon.Sometimes there's a line but the service is usually really fast anyway.",real
Just finished my slice of the doughnuts and have to take home a few different rolls all day and have everything for you.,fake

"The Oyster Bar is open 24/7 but there always seems to be a line. However, this place is worth the wait. We started off with a dozen of oysters and I'm generally very picky with oysters but these we're perfect- didn't taste too fishy and were also pretty big. We also tried the steamed mussels, which came with a large amount and were soaked in a delicious broth that we eventually used to dip with bread. The Alaskan clam chowder was also amazing with generous amounts of seafood within. LAST BUT NOT LEAST, the pan roast. Oh, the pan roast. It has me hungry when I'm full. I got the combo roast and added the andouille sausage (recommended if you're like me and prefer lobster over chicken). I got mine spicy and added lemon, creating the perfect ratio of creamy, cajun, lemony tomato sauce. If I had to choose one dish next time, it'd be the pan roast. To top it off, relatively cheap beer AND great service! The only downside is the wait. I will definitely be back and recommend to all!",real
We were here at MV. Out was the real deal. The burgers were delicious and the drink menu totally authentic.  I will definitely be back.,fake
We love this place. They cater if you want to eat something different every time I go its amazing.,fake

"This is the best chicken and waffles i have ever been to. When Mari ""squeaky voice"" let us know that there was kool-aid, i knew it would be good. The chicken was flavored perfectly like back home and cooked on point. That Kool-aid was SWEET as all get out, but took me back to the good ol days until i saw it was $3.50 lol. No worries though.The waffles with that cinnamon was lovely and the music was top notch. Im going back before i leave this dope place to get more lo lo's #3 and a fonky fresh shirt.",real

The environment was perfect for brunch and the perfect date night with my son and we really enjoyed our meal.  Fresh salads, reasonable prices, excellent service, and quick service. I always get the cuban white chocolate and it was so good. I will be coming back in the future.  We will be back!",fake

Not to mention, the menu is amazing with almost TOO many options. They make one of the best Beef Stew's I've had at pho, and you can get it as soup or on rice at this restaurant. Love it! Even though there are so many Pho's to try, this is one I will be going out of my way to come back to.",real

I don't care about any of the restaurants on the strip except for nobu and hakassan of course. This is where you need to eat when you are in Vegas. It's off the beaten path a little bit which to me is a plus but the place is always packed and I guarantee you will wait for a table. But guess what. It's worth it. While you wait you can go next door for a foot massage and a cocktail to get you primed for one of the best Thai meals you will have in your life. No frills and the staff is blunt and straight forward because they pump massive amounts of food out of this place everyday. Must must must have the Thai beef salad. Again. Get the Thai beef saladAlso the salt and pepper shrimp that is peel and eat. Unless you eat the shells which I do. As well as any greens sautéed up in their famous garlic sauce. Get in the cab and go to this restaurant.,real
"The concept of Asian Gelato sparked me to wanting to try this place. Not because I'm asian....well maybe yes that is a factor. I love gelato and adding an asian flair to it, I had to check it out. I coerced my friends to come with me after we had Ramen and they were glad I brought them!As soon as you walk up, the many flavours are written on a chalkboard before you enter into the store. The staff were extremely attentive, nice and patient. You are able to try out all the flavours as you please before making your final decision.The sizes come in Small (2 flavours), Medium (3 flavours) and Large (take away container).Flavours include: Durian, Jackfruit, Jasmine Tea, Lemon Chrysanthemum, Red Bean White Chocolate, Spicy Mango, Soursop, Strawberry Lychee  and Vietnamese Coffee (these were the ones that stuck out).Would I go back? Of course! Definitely a great hidden gem.",real
I'm a regular basis and I can say that this place was very special and the food was awesome. I will definitely be coming back here again.  Mastros and other nights are just great.  Ate here 5 days in a row.  Very consistent and a nice environment to sit in the hood.,fake
"Love this spot. Great coffee, awesome people, independently strong. I had a great conversation with the owner of the café. The location is really awesome and close (walking distance) to other independent shops. The lighting is really great in the café and plenty of seating. The coffee was fresh and juicy. We were greeted by many smiling faces and friendly hellos. Will be back soon!",real
"I had the Blue Moon cocktail. It's made with homemade moonshine which was super good. I think I've only had low quality moonshine haha.  For lunch Johnny had the house salad, I had the Kale salad. Both were very good.  I had them split mine so now I have lunch for tomorrow.  Then we split the lunch express with brisket and turkey. Very very good. The Cole slaw was different and good! I highly recommend this place.  Ask for Kerrin he's a great server!!",real

Amazing Personalized service and really original and distinctly and wonderfully flavored food.  The waiter was gregarious and Eddie took his personal time and creativity to ensure that one of our son's who has severe food allergies was treated to an amazing meal that was safe and tasty.

"We decided to come here after an adventurous road trip thru the city to find several of our initial restaurants either closed due to hours or renovations. So we landed at this place late at night. The restaurant was probably about half empty but you can still feel the good cozy atmosphere of a typical French restaurant. The inside decor was pretty decent and our waitress was pretty friendly and service was overall pretty good with no complaints.We had the soup of the day first which was really good. I don't know what da heck it was but it was dark greyish looking and again tasted really good with the bread. Then I ordered a few pints of beers to drink with my friends plus CASSOULET which is braised white lingot beans with lamb, pork belly, Toulouse sausage and duck confit. My other friends just ordered the Duck Confit, so I think with hindsight my meal was a better deal since I got the same size piece of duck plus some lamb, pork and sausage.The variety of extra meats was mixed in a nice juicy tangy broth sauce that was extra tasty. The lamb was soft and just melted in my mouth, and so did the pork belly since it was with fatty pieces of fat. The sausage was okay but still good enough to recommend. Of course the duck confit was the main part of the dish and it was quite good indeed. The duck was soft and tender, coming off the bone easily and when dipped into that tangy broth sauce it's definitely one of the better dishes to order in the menu. So overall, a really good French experience in a not so French city compared to Montreal or Quebec. I would definitely come back here again when given the chance. But make sure to bring your stack of credit cards as you can only afford to pay for yourself since it is French food and I haven't found a cheap French restaurant just yet.",real
"This was a truly special experience and one of the best meals of my entire life. Cut is a very upscale, classy establishment. The waiters and waitresses are absolute professionals. Every employee was kind and extremely knowledgeable about all of the food, wine and drinks. Dress code is business casual and this is enforced. No shorts or athletic wear is allowed. The majority of the men wore slacks, button up shirts and sport coats. The women were wearing dresses. Cocktails. I got the ""locked and loaded."" It was a combination of bourbon, scotch, maple flavorings, slight citrus and a maple finish. It was fantastic and very well balanced. After we were seated the waiter brought out several different raw cuts of meat to show us the marble pattern of the prime meats, American wagyu and Japanese kobe. He also explained the process of dry aging meats. I am very familiar with dry aged beef and just the description was making my mouth water. All of the meats looked fantastic. we tried the 35 day dry aged prime ribeye, NY strip American wagyu, 21 day ribeye, and Japanese wagyu (kobe) ribeye. All of their steaks were seasoned well with a perfect medium rare with a pink center and incredible sear. They are cooked over a charcoal and Woodfire and finished in a broiler which is 1800° to get a perfect seer 35 day dry aged prime ribeye. This is one of my favorite steaks of all time. At 35 days there is a beefy flavor which is more intense with an almost nutty flavor which enhances the already fantastic steak. I highly recommend this cut. 21 day dry aged prime ribeye. If you have never had a dry aged steak, then I recommend that you start with this. The beefy flavor, Funk is not that intense at 21 days yet you still get the advantage of a dry aging process. An excellent steak. American Wagyu NY steak: this is an excellent cut of meat and extremely marbled and tender. The meat melts in your mouth and was an awesome experience. Japanese Wagyu ribeye 6 ounce. This comes with both the ribeye cap and eye so that you can try both. This tiny steak was 180 dollars. When you go to Cut, at least one person your party needs to order this. The first bite I had was divine. I have had many wonderful steaks in my lifetime. I have been to many outstanding steak houses including STK, Mastros, Mortons and many others. At home, I buy whole prime ribeye and break them down myself before seasoning and making my steaks a perfect medium rare. Nothing compares to the Japanese earth at Cut. The meat melts in your mouth in a way so unique to steak because of the extreme marble. There is intense flavor, a perfect seer and just the right amount of simple seasoning to compliment the incredible beefy flavor. I had to  a bite of this steak to each of my friends at dinner so they too could partake in this unique experience. Sides: the mac and cheese is a decadent blend of many cheeses with a wonderful richness and a crunchy crust on top. This was my favorite side. This was a phenomenal meal and I will remember the Japanese Wagyu for years.",real
Truly a great place for breakfast. The food is always on point. The prices are reasonable and service is top notch. Be sure to ask for AVO from our host.,fake
"Had the filet mignon nachos and she loved it. I had the lasagna, and it was really good. The owner was very accommodating and nice with people.",fake

Very nice cive of a personal attached to come hungry. The prices reasonable for the quality of food. The staff and owner were very sweet and helpful. The food was delicious. I would recommend this to anyone who wants the surprisingly traditional Chinese food around where we live. So flavorful and the salsas are perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. I could eat that spicy eastern Italian meals.,fake
The food in this place is always my favorite but the service is promt it was incredible to the excellent service.  Price is fair.  Got beer so fast - and will be a regular stop for me some friends and write a review.,fake

"Exceptional service. Open past 10pm for late dinner.I was in Las Vegas for my birthday weekend and my friend and I were looking for a nice dinner at 10pm. It is hard to find a steakhouse open past 10pm but we found Mastro's and I am so thankful. We started with the lobster cocktail and it is huge. The lobster claws went past my expectations. And mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts with our 22 oz ribeye. The only bad thing is the location, it is right in the mall which I am not a fan of, but it is conveniently located on the strip. And the architecture is beautiful and modern.",real
Great food and excellent service! The service was great and the meal was delicious!,fake
"The food was extremely flavorful, and just the right size portion. I had the Bubble and Squeak - root vegetable patty, maple bacon, poached egg. The sauce was so good I was practically licking it off the plate at the end. My friends both got sandwiches which looked amazing, super fresh, large portions.Since they were a Food Network Cupcake Wars winner I had to get a cupcake. I got a lemon, cream cheese, fig cupcake. It was amazing, possibly the best cream cheese frosting I've ever had. Both the cake part and the icing are more dense, not airy like a lot of cupcakes, so even though it was small, it felt like a good sized dessert.The atmosphere reminded of a shop in downtown Portland, OR. My friend said it reminded her of the mom and pop restaurants in Australia.",real
"This place is unbelievably cute, the food is good and super healthy. It's so hard to find good vegan food sometimes, places like the cutting board make me really happy, staff are super super friendly! They make you feel like family, and they have good dessert!",real
"I ordered takeout online. I love the convenience of being able to do that. When I got there the woman behind the counter was very friendly. My food was up just a minute later. The food was still piping hot when I got home a few minutes later. It was also packaged very neatly, no leaky sauces coating the inside of the bag.We got pork fried rice, shrimp rangoon, seafood hot & sour soup, and sesame chicken. The portions were huge. I think we'll have enough left over for lunch and dinner again tomorrow. The fried rice was very savory and would be wonderful on a cold snowy day when you want something to warm you from the inside out.The soup was delish and my favorite part of the meal. The different textures made it delightful and it was so warm and flavorful!The sesame chicken came with the sauce on the side which kind of threw me at first, reminded me of sweet & sour chicken. The sauce was good though and the chicken seemed to be a higher quality than the breaded chicken you sometimes get at a Chinese place. I usually order a meat/veggie main dish as opposed to a breaded chicken dish so I'm anxious to try other things there.I hadn't had shrimp rangoon before, it was good.I think I may have a new Chinese favorite spot in Sun Prairie.",real
"Loud and chaotic but we like that.Each and every dish was amazing from the raw fish to the bowls.  Sadly, I do not remember the names of everything we orders as we ordered A TON and it just kept coming.  I believe that the Kimchi Nabe was one of the biggest hits.  The sticky stone rice bowl with curry in it that was stirred at the table was epic too.Can't remember what it was called, but we had this sesame, spinach ball that was amazing.  After reading reviews I was excited to try to fried chicken.  Honestly, I've had my fare share of legit fried chicken in my day.  I truly didn't feel as though this ranked at the top. It was good, but not nearly as good as the above dishes.",real

"Pinball, vegan seitan wings, and some of the best vegetarian sausage for I've ever eaten. This place was invented in my dreams and brought into reality by my fairy godmother, or so I like to tell myself. The people working there are super friendly, the local artwork being featured is often extremely unique, and the food is DELICIOUS. The pizzas made from scratch, the ingredients are organic, and I can't speak highly enough about their vegan seitan wings. The buffalo are great, but don't forget to try the honey mustard as well. Plus, they see my husband and I so often, we often get a few extra wings thrown in. I highly recommend this place, especially to vegetarians that might feel a little left out in a heavily meat-centric city.",real
I didn't know how I'd like the Singapore Slaw. I had heard great things but how much can you do with Slaw? A lot apparently. Every ingredient the chef chooses has a purpose and isn't too strong but you can taste each part. We loved the atmosphere. Not romantic at all as you're shoved in like sardines but the service and food was A+. Definitely would go back!,real
"Best place in the neighborhood to study and do work. Great environment, busy enough but not loud. Great food, from breakfast to lunch to dessert. Great service by the owner, Sean. He's super friendly and makes you feel like you're going to his home. Unfortunately the other workers aren't as nice or enthusiastic as he is, but not a deal breaker. The food is yummy but a bit expensive. Remember that the price includes tax (making people think it's even more expensive). The spicy sausage is really good.",real
"My BF and I shared the rib-eye and it was sooo delicious.  It was huge and was carved at table side.  The service was excellent and knowledgeable.  We also had the clams,  that was also delicious.

Great place to eat in Summerlin. Our server was very personable and friendly. We will be back!,fake
"Their menu is small but I'd eat probably everything on it so I still had a hard time deciding what I wanted to eat here. It was quiet when we went. Not a lot of people at all but they do have quite a lot seating & it is very spacious.While the food was good, they only use plastic utensils & cups which is not eco-friendly at all... :/ I ordered the beef stew w/ shrimp wontons egg noodle soup, my boyfriend ordered the seafood noodle soup, & we also shared the ribeye over noodles. Everything we had was so good. The beef in my ramen was so tender & I've never had better wontons in my soup. The seafood noodle soup was also delicious but I wasn't a fan of the big fish balls! But the broth was so flavorful & there was a variety of other seafood in there as well. I was super impressed with the ribeye over Noodles. The sauce they serve with it on the side was so good, it pulled the noodles & ribeye together into the perfect bite. We weren't expecting such a big plate of food since the price was quite low, but I would have been full if I ate the ribeye over noodles on my own! But together we finished everything & loved every bite!",real

"VEGAS BABY!!!!!About a year ago, I had a brief business lunch during my stay in the city of sin and conventions.  I was impressed with the quality of the food, the service and the decor.  This isn't your typical traditional sushi joint, where the decor makes you want to sleep.  I knew I had to come back and check it when the sun goes down and the sin city comes alive.This past Saturday night, my friend Carlos was able to set up dinner reservations for Saturday night, for me and my lovely wife.  Figure we could have some drinks and delicious food prior to heading out to a nightclub.  Not only did we get to enjoy delicious food and drinks (One Night Stand Bombs are a must), but we also got a show.  You get to enjoy a interacting experience in which there is a DJ, the staff dances and performs.  I am going to embrace my millennia status and note that the place was LIT!!!  This is definitely the perfect place to come and have a great dinner prior to going out, or just make it your place to have fun the entire night.  Food wise ""El Chapo"" is a must and their delicious Tacos are the bomb.com  If you are in the city, this a must.  Other perks, are the location (right across the street from the T-Mobile Arena) and other cool bars to partake prior or before your time there.  Contact my buddy Carlos for reservations: instagram.com/carlitosway78.",real
"Fantastic Service, Fantastic Food,Worth the $$$.Breakfast/Dinner are both great.",real

What a server is truly supposed to be like. We love !! Love!! Love this place :)",real
"I absolutely love the food here! I had never tried Brazilian food before I tried Carvalho's...and boy am I glad I did! I'm a vegetarian, and both the server and the owner took the time to tell me what their favorite vegetarian dishes were. I have not received this kind of service at any restaurant in a very long time! I also love that this is a family owned restaurant, and I could tell from the second I walked in the door. Everyone is smiling and the service is fantastic. Keep it up you guys!!",real
Wow was this place out here. Excellent food. Great service. Would recommend.,fake

"We have been waiting for this all year.   We're actually able to sit on the patio enjoying a lovely Sunday brunch.  After yesterday's storm burst from the weather cell out of the Gulf of Mexico, the temperature is absolutely gorgeous here in the valley!  This is what it is to live in Phoenix!Spent the morning pulling weeds and transplanting mesquite trees to work up a hearty appetite for some yummy Mexican food.  Ordered my usual bean and cheese Burrito and consider doing enchilada style but meh went sans extra sauce to enjoy the amazing salsa!I had the bean and cheese burrito Scott had the guacamole tostada and both were simply scrumptious.  Halfway through I kept telling Scott, ""I'm full, I'm full."" No matter how full I got, I just kept eating!Looking for a relaxing, Sunday brunch with chips & beer?  Los Dos Molinos is the place to be!",real
Super friendly staff and great staff. We had great service and there was an awesome server.,fake
Omg lots of sampling here! We had pistachio and maple/Nutella favor ice creams and maple dried cranberry here,real

The food was excellent! I tried their double burger and everything was delicious! My favorite was the Greek and the Beef Wellington and I enjoyed the chopped salad. I definitely will be back for another beer with my wife!,fake
Probably the only place on earth where I am willing to wait 2-3hours for a table to try their tacos and copious amounts of bourbon. Every time we go here the quality is amazing. They have a wall length chalkboard of bourbons to try and I've only made it through 6...I think there's about 30 or so? Basil Hayden= amazing! Cheap food. High consistent quality. Amazing bourbon list. Plan to visit a bar before putting your name on a ridiculous wait list when you go here...but they make it worth your wait 100% of the time.,real
Great food. Excellent service by Anna! She was super helpful from picking out the wine to our entrees!,real
The best place for Pho anywhere!!!! The atmosphere is very cool. Rocks!!!,fake
This is one of the best sushi joints in Vegas hands down.  Food is absolutely the only great thing about Phoenixs.  The pizza is also great.  Vicky is the best.  And the portions are huge!

"Every part of the dinner was exquisite.  Not only is this authentic, it is delicious. We started our evening with cocktails and an amazing bruschetta. Our server, Kathryn was poised and knowledgeable.  All of the ingredients are flown in from Italy.  We followed up with two pizzas. Each was remarkable.  Finally we shared one of the best panna cotta we've ever had. But wait!  Just as we thought we were done, out comes the owner with  a creamy limoncello.  We will definitely be back. This place knows how to do things. GREAT JOB!",real

You can have a soup with your plate as well.Their prices are great and you get a lot of food. Their chips are really good and they come with salsa and bean dip.",real

"I really enjoy this place, but now switching to vegetarian it really limits the selection. The waiter there was great very helpful. The vegetable Pho was decent, The vegetable broth tasted kind a like boiled water, but the noodles were great. And the vegetable Eggrolls (4 per order) were great especially with the lettuce wraps on the outside. And for the drinks I had a pot of hot Jasmine tea which was nice. And my wife had a fresh lemonade, which is not fresh lemonade, (probably Lipton's) haha.",real
Hibatchi steak was delicious!!! I had the white chocolate macadamia nut cheesecake for dessert because how can you resist their cheesecake options. Very good!!!,real

"Ever since my last trip to Toronto in May 2008, I couldn't wait to review this steakhouse.  Alas, Yelp did not allow reviews of Canadian businesses . . . until now.  I guess all my complaining and helpful suggestions finally paid off.  Probably not.Trust me, Hy's is so good, it's worth the hassle of getting a passport, figuring out the exchange rate, paying the ""3% foreign transaction fee"" to your bank, and making sure you don't go over 110 kilometers per hour on the expressway.Hy's is located within walking distance from Rogers Centre, which is why we made reservations at Hy's.  The steakhouse is located in the business district, and I imagine this place gets really busy on weekdays.  I imagine two-martini lunches, during which the top 1% discuss how to get into the top 1/2%.  We went there on Saturday, and the place was empty.You can't tell by looking at it from the outside, but Hy's feels like an exclusive private club.  Obnoxiously high ceilings, dark mahogany furniture, plush chairs and unmistakable scent of wealth.  I felt richer and more noble the minute I walked in.The service was absolutely impeccable.  The waiters were professional, knowledgeable and refined.  The place wasn't that busy, but my friend and I truly felt as though we got individual attention.  I had a great view of the table in the distance where assistant waiters were mixing our salads in giant bowls.  Everything--from the white tablecloths to the shiny utensils to the waiters' uniform--was top-notch.Oh, and then we had some food, too.  Hy's serves corn-fed Alberta beef, which is similar to our Nebraska beef.  My 18-oz New York strip ($49.95 Canadian Dollars) was truly one of the best cuts of beef I'd ever had.  I asked for them to hold the special Hy's sauce because I like my steak with nothing on it.  My friend had the 22-oz porterhouse, which he also enjoyed immensely.Just like at any other steakhouse in North America, the sides were over-hyped and overlooked by the restaurant.  They were good, but not that special.I know where I am having dinner the next time I am in Toronto!  Hy's is expensive, but, oh, so worth the money!",real
ok its not ghetto fab like red devil.... its different!!!!! but the pizza speaks for itself and is delish!!!! if you have a couple of hours to spare and want to try good pie stop here!!!!,real
The service is great! It was fast and the server was really nice! It's my 2nd time eating Pad Thai! I thought it was great :) It was cheap given the serving size. I'll come back for sure!,real
"This sushi is amazing. I have been to several restaurants and this is some of the freshest fish I've had. The Las Vegas roll is awesome. Also, their sashimi is unreal. Service is great. No complaints. Consider me a regular.",real
"Yummy. Seriously?  They don't charge pancakes but I love the multi-uk sauce but the deliciousness is more than enough for sitting and out.  One of the best tacos in town, and the people who work there are always pleasant and knowledgable. All the parking can be a little to be desire that really cares about the fresh product. Vegan tastes good and the service is great. Everything tastes so fresh and tastes amazing. The custard is also very good",fake
I was thoroughly impressed and found it on yelp and the staff had a great experience here. The food was super fresh and the service was great. The pizza was excellent and the service was good and the service was on point. We will be back!!!!!!,fake
Great staff and music good! I went with a group of 5 and had some great food that was fantastic!  I would definitely go back for another soup!,fake
"Tonight we had the pizza and the bartender, even though they're under $10 compared to other places.",fake
I am a weekly customer of this place and the staff is great and the food is always top notch. The fried ice cream is new and I crave it all the time. I have tried many sushi places and this place is by far the best,real
"I challenge you to find another pizzeria half as good as Pizzeria Bianco. After reading a few of the reviews on here about this place, I really am quite surprised. I have been here MANY times before and never once would I have given my pizza less than 9.5/10. Each pizza is handmade by the owner and baked in a stone, wood-fired oven. Who could ask for more?There seem to be a few people that don't understand the hours of waiting required to get a taste. Considering the entire building (including kitchen) is likely under 1000 sq ft, I think Bianco and his staff do an impeccable job at keeping things moving along. Sadly, they even have an entire additional building next door used just as a bar/waiting room. If you hear or read about people complaining of the wait, I would probably file these people under ""scrooges.""",real
"This is one of my favorite places to eat! The food is amazing, the service is great and the atmosphere is incredible!",fake
"The level of spiciness seems to depend on the chef. We went in the afternoon one time, ordered spicy level 6 and it was nice and spicy this time! I went with a combo pan roast with pasta this time and I loved it (:",real
I enjoyed the chipotle grilled chicken tacos (with caesar salad) and they were amazing. Also enjoyed the service and their caesar is the perfect compliment for brunch.,real
"Loved the Bell's Two Hearted American IPA they had on tap. The bartenders (2 guys) were engaging and fun, and the hummus was pretty good as well. Will definitely be back!",real
"Stopped by and wasn't sure if this was simply a remake of the prior restaurant or not. The  inside looks similar but menu was different. Anyway the owner? Came by and chatted with me, very nice guy. Food was fantastic. Best Thai I've had in squirrel hill. Quick courteous service. Would definitely go back.",real
"I had the prime rib sliders. Might be the best I ever had! I love the the Spicy Cheese & Loaves of Lawrence & Bulgogi, the food will make you back if you have a chance to check out.",fake
I was torn between this place and LGO but was at LGO for breakfast.  Pretty happy I picked Postino for lunch.  Sandwich selection was unique (Prosciutto with Brie) and the general ambiance during lunch was real nice.,real
"You must visit this place when you're in town or even if you live here!!! Guy, who is one of the partners is such an amazing man and always wants his customers to get THE BEST service! He immediately sat us down and made such a BOMB hooka! We even got a complimentary homemade humus with a homemade spicy sauce and pickles, it's a must try! Hands down a great hooka place and the environment was extra friendly, just like your home! COME SEE THEM!",real
The most lit gelato I've ever had. The salted peanut butter was my favorite. Definitely coming back for more,real
Service is always great and the food is amazing!! Lots of drink to choose from and the portions are large!Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The staff is friendly and makes this place a great first experience.,fake
"Okay, this place is great!  The rib-eye was close to Jocko's rib-eye flavor and texture and is one of the better steaks I've had in a long time. Hat's off to you!The service is top-notch. They use the tag-team approach so each server is hitting your table at different times. GREAT JOB GUYS!The devil eggs were okay, not home run, but good. The croutons in the will make you think about what they are - very flavorful. I liked them. The mash potatoes were great too as was the cucumber salad...of course I removed those suckers as I hate them!  The long island ice tea was unique too. Very good stuff.  I don't like chain restaurants, but I like this one!",real

"Best Singaporean food in the City and I ain't Lion!Seriously. I came here with the family on a Sunday morning - we were the first customers there. Our server gladly seated us and we made our order:SatayGoat rendangBeef panang curryBeef hor fanWonton soupCoconut riceBriyani riceThere was not one thing that we were not amazed with.The satay came with 6 skewers which were slightly on the small side, but they were packed with flavour. When dipped in the accompanying peanut sauce, few things taste better.The goat rendang and beef panang curry dishes were both seasoned to perfection, both of them equally as delicious. Beef hor fan - a noodle dish with black bean and large cuts of beef - again, nothing to complain about. Rices and soup were also up to Lion City's very high standard. Having tried a wide range of their dishes, I'm comfortable in recommending this restaurant to anyone. Their dishes are flavourful and delicious, their service is great, and the owners are among the nicest people you'll meet. Definitely go check it out.",real
"I was craving Beef kebab and found this place, great food, great service, very clean and Chris checked up on me plenty of times to make sure I was ok as I ate in the restaurant.  Highly recommend this place if you are in the Henderson area.  I will be coming back.",real
"We have bought the halal or vegetarian pizza mostly. Got $2 off twice. All my sister does is order on the phone and we pick it on the way home. I love the butter chicken, garden veggie, veggie korma .. The portion size is pretty good. Service is good. People working their are nice. I was amazed when I saw a man with burnt arms last time when I visited. That would be the only reason of me not buying pizza..Hope Panago's management understands and takes it seriously. Obviously, I would not like to see anyone be burnt that much for my pizza!:(((",real
"I love this neighborhood joint. The staff is kind, the coffee is on point, food will have you coming back and the location is ideal. So nice to mosey over on a Sunday morning and relax with a fantastic savory crepe. Outdoor seating in back and front. In door seating limited but there are people coming and going. Will be back many times.",real
Our server was very knowledgable and helpful! I half off four himself.,fake

"The food was great! I had the Blackened Salmon it was delicious very moist.I also had the Alpine Village soup I am a local,  and the soup was good but I didn't think it taste like Alpine Village, I love the Broads with the old Vegas look very nice touch as well as the live piano !! Defiantly recommend",real
"This place has it all. The decor is absolutely modern yet does not lose function as the seats and eating areas are very comfortable. Servers are very knowldgeable regarding their foods and wines and the bartenders are hot. Service is up there and they even replaced an already half-eaten borderline medium-welldone mignon with a medium (which is what it was supposed to be) for a friend of mine. Sides to devour: lobster mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, gnocchi with white truffle oil. Aside from their choice wine selection, their main dishes are absolutely fantastic. I had the filet mignon. #1 in my book and I've had filet mignon in many highly rated restaurants in the bay area. Their creme brulee (tahitian) was perfect. Smooth, silky texture and taste was perfectly rich enough to rouse the palette yet subtle enough for me to want more!I highly suggest making this steakhouse a number 1 destination next time you are in vegas!",real
"Amazing!!! Yes, its Phoenix airport  come here for the best deli ever. Food is always delicious, service is fast and friendly, food is good, too!",fake

"Great little breakfast/lunch place. We love the Jersey Mikes Burgers! :) I just wish they had one in Hawaii for one of those hollandaise!!! Great service! Will definitely be back when we are on that part of town. The dirty rice was the perfect ending. Nothing other reviews from my childhood but I always enjoy their food and EVERYTIME! The staff is friendly and they get you feel at home. They have many good burgers there, so for an authentic Mexican fare. Definitely try the pot of bread . Highlights of the strip, Chicago-style, and good music! Made my family loved it. Onion rings were the best we had in a long time. My friends recommended this place and it was all AMAZING!!!

We ordered the Onion Rings as a starter and they were crispy and delicious, with the dipping sauce also being very tasty. My girlfriend doesn't normally go for onion rings, but she said they were the best she ever had. The Fish and Chips were delicious, crispy and flaky. The Steak and Guinness pie was hot, hardy and filling. The servers were super friendly, and made sure everything was going great with our meal without being intrusive. We will be going back to try more of the menu. Will be recommending to all our friends and family.",real

I love bringing my peeps from Cali here too when they visit. They also love it. The other dishes are great as well but any Pho bowl is great! Yum!",real
"I did 90% of my shopping from this mall. It had a wide range of outlet stores to choose from and it was easy to get around. What was also awesome is the parking stall indicator. If there was a parked call, it would have a red light above the stall. If it was empty, the light would be green. Very, very helpful when looking for parking.",real

Not too spicy but it was really different.  The big Shawarma is so good!  I dream about that tea at counter, drinks are for you but the service was great, I will definitely be returning service and miss the food itself. The mini chimis are hands down the best I have ever had.   Love the build your own salad or the breakfast too...and it's all good for small good deals for such a treat!",fake

"The BEST Italian in Lower Burrell!  I usually take out, but I've eaten in a few times as well.  Service is always good, everything is always prepared quickly.  I've never had a dish I didn't like, and that includes pizza, wings, pasta, salads, soup & sandwiches.  The prices are very reasonable, especially when you consider how much food you get!  They have the traditional fare you qould expect at an Italian restaurant, PLUS (and this to me - as a bit of an Italian food snob - is the mark of a truly great place) They have dishes of their own creation that you don't find anywhere else.  I can't say enough good about this place!",real
"Good food and a lot of options for veggie perfectly. They make their own bowls to salami. Prices are meal but excellent taste.  It is a lot of fun, and the friendliest people in the valley.

"My husband and I love this place! Everything was fresh and tasty and flavorful! We had the knife hot sauce, the chicken with peanut butter and crab roll as well as their tacos. The prices are very reasonable for the quality.  I wish I lived closer, this seems to be one of the best meals I have ever eaten.  And the best prices are pretty great too.",fake
Amazing. Great bar back for breakfast. Food was fantastic with summer menu!,fake
"Visited this place more than 5 times already and very happy with its food and service. Chicken/ beef souvlaki dinner,  chicken wings, stakes - everything is very tasty and portions are huge for that comparatively small price. At my first visit the owner presented the pen with the name of the place as a small souvenir.",real
Love coming to the Corner for a good time with my friends! The atmosphere is always fun and their black pepper wings are the absolute best!!!,real
"It's been 5 years, and this place was even better than we remembered. I had the Malai Kofta with the yellow fried rice, Hubby had the chicken Tikka Masala, with basmati rice. We had the pakoras for our starter. A couple of naans as well. The naans are amazing. So light and fluffy.We have enough food for another meal tomorrow. We might even go back on Thursday for their Thanksgiving Dinner Buffet. It's THAT good.One weird thing though is the water. It's disgusting! No clue why. Guess we'll have real drinks next time.",real
"In-N-Out is a must try, just GO SANDI AREA. I ordered the Brunswick Chicken sandwich with pesto and a sour cream so tasty and the taro boba we ordered was heavenly!  We will go back when I'm in the area.",fake
"I ordered a wrap. The employee who made my beautiful masterpiece, Andrew (I think that was his name) handled the process with the most professional manner. Not only was he generous with the portion sizes, but he arranged each and every piece of my wrap beautifully. When faced with the daunting task of rolling the entire bad boy up, he rolled up his sleeves and assured me not to worry. A true hero that we all need, but don't deserve. A very accommodating host, Andrew should definitely receive praise as well as promotion for his revolutionary service for he created a true masterpiece. Andrew truly placed every component and ingredient into the wrap as if they were his own children. The most enjoyable part of it all was the experience of Andrews flavors exploding into my mouth and being able to taste each and every flavor of andrew's children as the intense sensation flooded every part of my pallet. A truly sensational dish and an experience I will never forget. Thank you, andrew.",real
"Jun's is my go to place for Korean food cravings. Big portions of good food at low prices. They have the best homemade fried mandoo with filling that's mostly meat, not all bean sprouts and cabbage. Since they're from Hawaii, its also one of the few places you can find meat jun - thinly sliced and marinated beef, egg battered and pan fried. I guess meat jun is a Hawaii born ""Korean"" dish, so its hard to find on the mainland. I usually get the 3 meat combo plate for $10 - choice of kalbi, bulgogi, spicy pork, meat jun, BBQ chicken or spicy chicken. If you eat there you get all of the banchan sides, with take out you get a choice of 3. Their kimchee is slightly sweet and pretty spicy. My fav sides are the fried tofu, shoyu potatoes, cucumber kimchee, bean sprouts and fried zucchini. They're open everyday and I've always had friendly service. Everything is cooked to order with just 1 cook, so it can be a little slow if they're busy. But nothing crazy.",real
"Talk about being foodie side swiped by a random suburban Italian restaurant. I meet my mom here for dinner and to be honest, my mom's taste in restaurants mostly falls into the ""chain"" categories, nothing fancy and convenient. So I was surprised when I read the reviews on Ventano's and more even more taken back by the look of the place.Normally I avoid places that have the words, ""Video Poker"" or ""24hr Lounge"" on the side of the building. This just says mediocre food and smoke filled rooms of sad degenerates. Not the case here at all here, first off the bar with the Video Poker is 100% separated from the dining area and is sealed off with heavy glass doors. The dining area is completely smoke-free, not a hint of smoky smell seeps into the dining room. The view from the dining area is amazing; really no matter where you sit in the dining area you'll get a full view of the Vegas valley. I do recommend sitting in the raised portion of the dining room for a fully unobstructed view or if the weather is nice just enjoy the patio and glass of wine.  We ordered Grilled Shrimp on the Stone to split and two chicken Caesar salads. Not the normal hearty Italian meal, but I had just left the gym. The shrimp was amazing and seasoned simply with garlic and lemon, served literally on a searing hot stone. It also comes with two side dipping sauces, but these shrimp are so good on their own that you really don't need them. I know what you're thinking, can a chicken Caesar salad really be that good? Yes, the mountain of greens, chicken and dressing was delicious. Not overly dressed, just a touch of Parmesan, but what really made this so good was the way the chicken was prepared. You could tell it had been flattened with a mallet, seasoned and seared on a super hot surface to create that crunch on the outside while still juicy on the inside. The salad game is strong with this place. The service was immaculate from top to bottom. Plates cleared quickly and my water glass was never empty. I will definitely be back and my next trip will include a little vino and some ravioli or gnocchi.",real
Very friendly staff and very friendly staff and the best flavored tasting coffee in Vegas. I absolutely love this place!,fake
"Great authentic Persian food here! Paulina, our food runner, was excellent as well! Very friendly and a treat to engage with!",real
"This place is fantastic. The milkshakes are big, so werry. The people are so nice. Good prices. I will go back every time I'm in Vegas.",fake
The Salmon teriyaki had many of the other places have in a little blane. The service is spot on and the prices are very reasonable. I can never finish the entire experience!,fake
My husband and I stopped in for brunch on a few days and still stopped in to enjoy it more than once and really enjoyed it.  Highly recommended.  The beer battered tofu was the best I've ever had.  Ever.... place to eat at and would highly recommend it.  Look no further.,fake
"To echo other reviews: Fast, Cheap, and Simple.Situated in one of the smaller food courts in the PATH system, this place is a real find.During the lunch hour, on your way to or from The Bay through the underground, it's actually easy to spot this place because there is consistently a long line-up. One sign as to whether or not a place as good is if the ethnicity of the patrons match the food that is being served. Looking at the lineup, you'll notice that it's at least 90% Asian (which may include myself).I actually aim to be there just before noon but if you are stuck in the lineup, they efficiently have the line move along fast. So the point of getting there early is mainly so that you can get a seat in the food court.I always order the wonton noodles and basically you just point to the kind of noodles you want, ask for scoops of spicy broth if you want and then choose between pork or shrimp wontons. They also have rice dishes with BBQ pork, and chicken and sides of fried dumplings.The prices have gone up slowly over the years but you can get away with a good meal for under $6 unless you buy a drink.",real
I love this quaint food spot and the food is awesome! One of the best places I've seen and nothing considered. The signature salad was so good! I'd recommend this place for anybody in old town to go to Wonton.,fake
This is my go to spot for breakfast. It's set up with a cool experience. I got the pickled cucumber salad with chicken and it was very good. The carne asada duriantly she was really good and I accommodated you as long as I would give it in often!,fake
The food was soooo good. The gyoza was excellent. Had hot peppers and bacon and eggs. So good! Will def be back again!,fake

I love the olive taquetos, the assortment of plates are also very good and moderately priced. Great restaurant with excellent service. We would definitely return.",fake
Had two different visits at Rosa every week!  My wife and I each ordered the omelette and it was great.  If your in the area you have to eat here.  Can't beat that price and the food is great.  Their service is great and food is fantastic.  There is a reason why they don't allow me to take my order strong and taste is awesome!,fake
"Tried this place last night..it was really good. Great for 4-8 people as it kind of serves family style..I will definitely be back, great atmosphere and good food. The soy garlic wings were really good with the most crispy skin on chicken I've ever seen, try them and you'll see what I mean...kimchi slaw was great, sweet potato birds nest great, pimento corn was different but great also.",real
"Asian fusion tapas is how I would best describe Jayde Fuzion and Seonkyoung, the new Food Network star surely delivered with her culinary vision and concepts!My advice is to go in a group of 4 and order a bunch of dishes and share.   We loved the Crab Salad - I believe this was one of the dishes featured in the early episode of Restaurant Express.  The salad was so fresh, light and refreshing.  The crab salad is paired with these lettuce endives and sesame wonton chips to scoop the crab goodness up.  This was one of our favorites.You can't go wrong with the lettuce wraps stuffed with pork belly....YES....pork belly.  Next time I will get the Duck sliders and Korean street tacos as we saw many tables having these dishes.  There are many traditional Korean dishes such as Japchae and Kalbi and for less adventurous eaters you can order a cashew chicken.  There's an even a full blown sushi bar.  There's definitely something for everyone.   The best part is most entrees are in the $8 to $15 range so you can order several and share.  Be sure to save room for desserts.  We really enjoyed the Yuzu Donuts - I could eat a dozen of those.  Hopefully chef will bring her famous sticky Asian bbq Ribs.  If you're in the area, be sure to check out this new Asian gem at the M Resort.",real

"Man! I came here for lunch and was expecting a tasty burger and this place did not disappoint.I had a Steakburger ( C.A.B. with caramelized onions, white cheddar, and a sauce ) and some Garbage Fries ( Fries, cheese, Buffalo chili, jalapeños, green onions, olives ) and it was amazing! There are a few places that I would consider a great burger place and this place is definitely on my list of those places. The price is pretty Las Vegas, which is what you should expect, but I think you get what you pay for with that considered. I would definitely come back the next time I'm staying in the area!",real
"Everything was delicious.  I had the sirloin and my friend had the mac n cheese and my husband had the chicken and waffles. Both were delicious, the restaurant is small so be prepared for a premium in my book.",fake
"I think the food quality has been covered through most of the other reviews, but I'd like to pitch in as well.APPS: Saganaki is fantastic. Between two people it's a good amount of food when paired with the pita bread.ENTREES: Lamb Burger is fantastic. I've gotten it twice and it's been perfect both times. Recommend the greek potatoes as the side. Also the Lasagna is impressive and has great flavor. The portion is enough to definitely take some home.SERVICE: Great service. This is really where they did a great job. We went on a Wednesday night for an anniversary dinner but I wasn't sure what time we'd go so I didn't make a reservation. Well the restaurant was packed and we had the option of taking a table outside. It was a little chilly but they turned on the heater for us, however it just didn't have the same feel / ambiance as it does inside. So we said we weren't sure if we were going to be able to stay (40 min wait) since we couldn't be inside. Manager was the one that came to check on us and he immediately found us a table and set us up for dinner. Don't know where the table came from but I'm not complaining because they really saw to make sure we had a good dining experience. We'll be back many times in the future.",real
"First time here, had great sandwiches and a beautiful texture of traditional French toast and butternut squash ravioli.  The best I've had in a while, the location is great and the service is amazing! We purchase your own pizza and their pork enchiladas with ranch and even time to come here more than any of the other ramen places in Edinburgh.  The crab cakes are to die for!  My favorite is the chirashi bowl poutine.  They are the best!  Their food is so good!!  Great service!  Plus they have real feelings!!!!",fake
"Absolutely the best mexican place in Vegas.  The atmosphere, the music and the food seal the deal.  I had the carnitas platter, and it is excellent.  the spices they use on the meat is wonderful, the chips and salsa are fantastic and the margaritas are perfect.  It's a bit off the strip, but worth the walk or the cab ride.",real
"Excellent service and food. The tuna melt was tender and flavorful, and the lobster tails are very good.",fake
"Great flavorful burger!!!! Well worth the $18. The waitress told me to order the Gold Standard and she was right on the money. The meat was so juicy and flavorful. Do not put ketchup on this burger!!! When they delivered my burger they gave me the great advice of not adding ketchup until I tried a bite. So glad they told me that because it was so delicious without it.I really can't tell you much about the fries. I think I liked them, but I was so into my burger that I couldn't tell you much about them. I actually ordered a Martini to go with this steak burger and it couldn't have been more fitting. The service was great. I decided to sit up at the bar since I was rolling solo. Eating an amazing burger, sipping on a Martini and reading Steve Jobs biography. My most mellow dinner in Vegas ever! Enjoyed every bit of it. I will make sure next time I am in Vegas I visit and bring my friends for the best burger I have had in quite some time.",real

"This is my favorite restaurant.  The food is always excellent  and the staff very friendly.  I love their  coconut -chicken soup. Its taste is so unique, it's that perfect thai balance of savory and sweet. For my main entrée  i usually get one of the curries - they are all faboulous. If your new to thai id recommend the panang. Sometimes i'll get the bbq chicken which is hands down the most delicious  bbq ive ever had. Its sweet and tangy. And you get a half chicken. The price is inexpensive  with each dish costing around $7. I highly recommended.",real

"LOVE this place!  George's Gyros makes it fresh when you order. We eat here every chance we can when we're on this side of town.  The service has always been great and everything is perfect and tasty every time we go.  Note that this is NOT a fast food place and you are probably better off taking your hungry, tired kiddos to McDonalds or Taco Bell; you will wait a little longer for your meal to be prepared (fresh) than going through a drive thru - so please keep that in mind before you go here.  If you ARE in a hurry and need a gyro fix your best bet is to simply order ahead as take out so it will be ready for you when you get there.",real

"Today was an exciting day folks.. we ordered lunch from Big Shot Bobs.  It was hard to decide with - what 100 flavors on the menu!  Of course I did my research on yelp and read up on some reviews and I took my top five and just picked two at random to try.    ""Talk of Beaver Falls"" - Hot and Tangy.  This blend was definitely my favorite..raise the roof!   Its true to the name and flavor was very original ..  go ahead Big Shot Bobs.   These are NOT for sharing that's for sure and I am not sorry.   I loved to dip my french fries in the left over sauce.  I will never forget those wings. ""William Henry Harrison"" - Jamaican Jerk and Parmesan Cheese.   Very interesting and flavorful however - the wings were in at least an inch of sauce and most of it was butter.   and I also tried "" Black Frank White""  Franks Red Hot and Ranch and Black Magic Seasoning.    I was quite intriqued to find out what this seasoning was all about since its peppered throughout the menu.  I think it's a blend of seasoned salt and maybe two other spices.  Definitely interesting and tasty.  The are a dry rub and the franks red hot and ranch combination.. is what ...a match made in heaven of course. The bed of fries were interesting .. the wings are served on top of the fries. What a fun and clever idea!  After learning that  a plain side of fries is just ""meh"". I love my wings crispy and well done and this is how the wings are delivered..  horray There is more to the menu than just wings.. salads and sandwiches and when was the last time you saw ""Sloppy Joe's"" on a menu!!  Love it.    I am no doubt very impressed.... Thanks Big Shot Bobs!!!",real

"The BEST gumbo in Phoenix! We have lived in the South and this gumbo is as good as the South has to offer. It's a smaller restaurant setup like a bar with stools surrounding the chefs' who prepare meals fresh in front of you. Each and every bowl of gumbo is prepared to your specifications (ie type of meat, fish, poultry, etc; spicy scale 1-10). They are cooked individually in a pot designed specifically for gumbo. Unfortunately, we have never tried anything else because the gumbo is the star of this restaurant. However, that is probably a good thing.",real
I highly recommend this place. Fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection.,fake
I am writing this review based completely about the pizza served here. I have not tried anything else on the menu. I will say I am a fan of good pizza. I enjoy all kinds from thin crust to deep dish and everything in between. First let me say if you want pizza like pizza hut or domino's this isn't the place for you. The pizza here is east coast style the kind that flops a little and you have to fold to eat. The pizza is not overly greasy and the sauce is delicious! The location is a bit out of the way but its worth it. They have a 24hr kitchen so you can get a great pizza anytime. The standard 18in cheese pizza will run you about $15 here and is one of the best pizza's I have ever had in las vegas.,real
Mmmm it's the best rotisserie chicken I've ever had. Brisket and beef tendon burger are delicious.,fake

"My brother, who was on leave, loves this place. Seeing my brother happy is what matters. So, 5 stars goes to Drift. Granted, it was a lowkey Thursday night. Only a few patrons were sprinkled around the place; some even outside close to the fire. I ordered a pitcher of Four Peaks' Island Ale. Why? Because as they said in Boston, it's cheapah! Besides, I had never had it before; it's quite good! Our server was kind enough to let me sample the Kona Lager and the Ale before I ordered. Did I finish the pitcher? Heck no. Can one person seriously drink all that? Wowza. My bro enjoyed their Jack and Cokes. And the music was cool. A very interesting mix. At one point, my bro requested ""Pepper"" by the BHS. They played it! That made my brother's night, and, like I said earlier, seeing my bro happy is what it's all about. I ordered their little kabob app - one shrimp, one chicken, one beef. It was merely okay. I wouldn't order it again. Frankly, I wasn't impressed with their menu. I probably wouldn't suggest eating here, but if you want to stop in for a drink or to try the rare Four Peaks' brew, then it's a great spot. I like the outside area (minus the smoking) and enjoyed the decor of the inside. Oh, and the servers look like they're actually comfortable at work - comfy shoes, track suits. They're also very nice, unlike other Scottsdale establishments. Like John V said, this place is a cool spot to wind down... or, if you're looking to get out for a little bit, go on a lowkey night. You'll likely have the place to yourself.Again, 5 stars for makin' my lil brother happy.",real

"I celebrated my birthday at this fine restaurant and it was absolutely delicious. I started off the evening with the signature Singaporean slaw. HIGHLY RECOMMEND, actually it is a must have! The 19 ingredients are perfectly paired and each create an essential flavour to the slaw. Its crunchy, sweet and salty. The perfect blend of flavours. I also ordered the Jerusalem artichoke. The artichokes were delicious, especially when paired with the goat cheese and pumpkin seeds. To finish off the evening I had the pulled beef and braised onion peeking crepe. When deciding on a meat dish I asked the waiter what he recommended and he suggested the beef crepe and i'm glad I listened, it was flavourful, and seasoned perfectly. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant. It is great for date night, special occasions or group outing.",real

Can't wait to come back. Food was excellent, and the service was also welcoming. Staff was super friendly and professional. I will definitely come back next time I'm in town!",fake
"An equisite dining experience. Yes, we expected it to be expensive (came out ~100$ per person before tip), but we'll worth it. Our party of 6 on had a wide variety of meals, including steaks pork and fish. We also tried five of the sides. No one was displeased.Let's get a little specific. We start with a bread plate that was an incredible variety ... I wish I could remember them all. The Blue Point oysters were very nice, although a slight heavy on the tarragon. The beef wellington was fabulous. The steaks were some of the best we ever had ... but a sharper steak knife would have been nice. I went with the waiters recommendation and the brussel sprouts were to die for. My family also thought the potatoes were fabulous, both finger and pureed.The waiter recommended another home run with the toffee dessert. Decadent. Bummer they were out of my favorite port.Well done Gordon, and to your entire team. But as said in other Yelp posts, retire the current steak knives.",real
Amazing tasting food. They have specials/drink menu choices.,fake
"The food here is fantastic!   It's a hidden gem in Scottsdale.  Fantastic service and beautiful food !!    Bursting with flavor and at a reasonable price.   Next time I am in the area I will go out of my way to eat there.. Enough said...the coffee is great & the salsa you can take it all week on the flyer! I always stop in when I'm on this side of town to visit Phoenix. We ended up ordering from here when I was searching for Italian. Food was great, service was great. Our waiter was extremely helpful and personable. I will definitely be back!",fake
"My family and I have just returned and enjoyed everything!  I would sooo recommend this place. The food was prepared and presented with such class.  Honestly,  my fiancee and my future bro in law,  almost cried and literally talked about how great the food was,  the whole car ride home,  and then some.  Seriously,  get down here and experience heaven,  with just one bite!",real
One of my favorite restaurants in Toronto! Food is always good and so is the service!,fake
Service was quick and friendly. Food was perfect. The fresh fruit crepes are amazing. Have to come back again and again.  Maybe week try something else?,real

This is a wonderful place for lunch or dinner. We were shopping and stopped in for lunch!  Outstanding service and food!  Great prices!!! We loved it so !!!,real
"Amazing tacos!  They grill their meat on an open flame and it definitely makes a difference.  Their asada is my favorite!  They are a little pricy, but they are worth every penny.",real
"Just tried out Fibber's on the way home with some friends the other day. All of us would agree that this is a 5-star. The atmosphere was very cool, open and easy to get around. The service was excellent and our waitress was very attentive. The beer was great and great selection! The food was outstanding. 2 of us got fish and chips and it was huge! A large piece of fish right on top a gigantic order of fries, definitely a knife and fork meal. 1 of my friends got a shepard's pie and it was also huge. He said it was delicious and judging by the dent he put in it, he wasn't lying. Myself and another friend got a burger and it was so damn good and  cooked perfectly to medium as I had asked. I Got bacon because I'm a man and it was a different type of bacon but was insanely delicious along with the great fries. $5 burgers on Mondays or all you can eat fish and chips on Friday's we saw there, so we'll definitely be back. Huge fan, would love to see some live Celtic music that people are talking about below. Try this pub, especially if you love a good atmosphere and pub food!",real
"Love this place. For $14.99, all you can eat Korean BbQ is a huge deal. I love the short ribs the most, so tender and tasty. I don't know if it's true but on the menu it stated that you would be charged $1 for each piece left-over. The all you can eat menu includes sushi and ice cream as well. Definitely will come back when i visit Montreal again",real
"Delicious, cheap food at the airport and very friendly staff.  I asked about the soups and the gentleman behind the register didn't hesitate to make a recommendation. I got the Tuscan Tomato which came with a piece of baguette and butter. Super creamy and super tasty. Took all of the stress out of my body and I got to sit and relax before my flight back to Vegas.",real
"This is the best breakfast secret in Vegas!  A continental breakfast buffet that starts with beautiful table service in a small stylish art nouveau influenced 16 table tea room with white leather banquettes.  This is a place that seems like it is right out of the 1940's to dazzle your mom, your Auntie Mame, for a special treat, or just to get away from the hustle of the casino.  After choosing delicious french roast coffee and orange juice, you can select from the most delectable assortment of croissants and other pastries that are the finest you can imagine; a selection of bagels with the best quality HOUSE-MADE smoked salmon, cream cheese wedges, capers, thinly shaved red onion and delicious red ripe tomatoes; 'parfaits' of yogurt with their own house made granola, cereals and milk, and other accompaniments.  Everything presented is of the highest quality, and makes you feel like you've taken a quick trip to Paris!  If you desire something else, there is a full menu including incredible omelettes and brioche french toast as well, but the deal here is - Continental Breakfast Buffet!  I think it was even under $20. with tax and tip, and stuffed as you are, I swear you will go back again before the end of your Vegas trip for more desserts, cafe au lait, sandwiches and snacks, and maybe even the late night Dessert Tasting Menu...  But definitely start with the breakfast!",real
"Absolutely incredible!  So tasty, and the staff is so friendly there.  But the place is really clean and inviting on a weekend dinner!

"this shop is 100% fantastic!!! my friend and i made the trip out from the strip after she raved about the fresh turkey sub she'd had with her husband a year ago. besides some really roundabout directions, the trip was definitely worth the short drive out from the main strip! reasons to make your way out to this shop:-the turkey is roasted fresh every day and melts in your mouth!-during the time we were there, people from NY, Philly, California, and Texas came by, put the philly sandwich to the test, AND loved it!-Ruth is one of the sweetest people i met and makes you feel like you're family!

"Just wanna start and say our server Danielle was the bomb diggity. Everything we ate was absolutely insanely good!!! What a spot peeps. My colleague, whomst is a self-appointed and critically acclaimed short rib connoisseur, has formally appointed Black Sheep as one of the best. Bao sliders too ... some of the most sickest sliders around. Bitchin' soundtrack and amazing cocktails. Got a brown sugar-soaked (Mr. Brownstone) ice cube ignited in front of my very eyes!!!

"Tucked in an alley near Yonge/Sheppard, Mymy Chicken is in my opinion the BEST Korean fried chicken in the Yonge/Finch-Sheppard area. I've tried The Fry, Kokoya, Dagoki, Cheers Chicken and Beer, etc etc. The crispness and taste is unmatched and you should definitely come here. Like go, right now. Food ****I've tried the onion, green onion, gold cheese, and the chili fried chicken here. My faves are definitely the gold cheese and green onion (budak). Price is standard for KFC places ($~28 ish for a whole chicken that can feed 2-3 people) and they have the usual sides you can order like fries, egg soup, rice cake, etcetc. They have some unique alcohol so be sure to try one or two.Service ***Service was good, they have one of those buttons so you can call the waiter and they never seemed to be understaffed regardless if the restaurant was full or not although it doesnt seem that there are buttons on every table.Ambiance ****Decor is rustic but still comfy, really liked the vibe eating there and it always attracts a young crowd. This place can get full so be sure to plan accordingly, especially during Friday/SaturdaysTips/Closing comments- Order half/half and try different flavours- Try to get there early on busy nights (Thurs/Fri/Sat)- If you're a fried chicken lover don't think twice about trying this place",real

"My husband and I were visiting the area with some friends and we came to Postino's for the Tuesday night special. The atmosphere, bruchetta and wine was great! The apple and fig bruchetta was our favorite. We will definitely go back next time we are in the area.",real
"Just gonna say. My husband and I love this place. We've come here many times. Atmosphere is awesome. Service has mostly been awesome. I've been here for Valentine's Day, Thanksgiving, also did a dinner with my whole family after my wedding I had out here. Did the wine tasting on Tuesday which was fun. So, hope this place stays forever.",real
"I am of the clan of Reuben Fiends. You can tell we're coming from the scent of thousand Island wafting through the air a full two minutes before we enter the room. We try to insert the word ""corned"" into as many sentences as possible. And we hover dangerously close to proposing marriage to a man who has good sauerkraut. Well, fellow fiends, the quest is over, because the best Reuben in Cleveland, nay, the state, has been found! It resides in Mister Brisket, in a charmingly humble store with friendly staff who will learn your name and ask you how your family has been. Forget Slyman's, they're a one trick pony that thinks more meat = better meat, and that's just not true. Quality over quantity dictates Mister Brisket comes out on top. All the meats here are of solid quality, and locals in the know are aware that this is the place to get the best steak or burger or ribs for their next cookout. The smells alone when you step in the door here will make you swoon in carnivore heaven. All sandwiches you can order come quick, and are reasonably priced. They run great Tuesday deals on the sandwiches, so I would always come on Tuesday for the discount. I love their pastrami and corned beef. Their Reuben is a work of art. You know this place means business when the second you order your sandwich they get a massive fork and take a large hot side of corned beef out of a delicious bath and slice it fresh to layer on the sandwich. The bread is the right kind of rye, the kraut is assertive, they are not stingy with the thousand island, and they press the sandwich enough to really perfectly melt the cheese and get a buttery crunch on the outside. But the star of the sandwich, and 80% of its bulk is succulent, fall apart thick sliced corned beef. It's handheld perfection, this sandwich.  Run (at least that way you can burn off some of the calories preemptively) to Mister Brisket, unhinge jaw and insert perfect Reuben. I'll race you there!",real
"This review gets a 5 star just on the chef himself. As I walk in, the lady that I believe owns the restaurant seats me, but is a little busy with some other tables.. I was taken back some since the chef noticed me and comes out of the kitchen and proceeds to help me out with the choices on the menu. No kitchen staff has actually ever given me personal recommendations on food, talk about awesome!! I ask him about the purple corn drink on the menu, so he gets a small sample of it for me. Kinda fruity, sweet, but not an overwhelm of sugar. So I ordered a glass of that.As my eyes scan past the rotisserie chicken dish,  I asked him if I could get that, in which he says they only serve that Fri.-Sun. Damn. He then helps me pick out the Pollo Saltado (stirred fried chicken with fries).They automatically bring a bun with a special spicy sauce with every meal, the sauce has the perfect spice to it. The dish itself was slightly oily, but was pretty good. Could have used a little more rice, but the whole thing was definitely an interesting and new taste for me.Excellente!",real
"Omg. The best smoked meat sandwiches ever. This was my first meal AND last meal in Montreal. The first time, the take out next door was closed so we just asked for take out from the restaurant instead. They did have plenty of available tables but we just wanted to enjoy these delicious sandwiches in the confines of our hotel. I did expect the sandwiches to be like a foot high like the ones from Katz, but this was more on the smaller side. Although, it is a lot cheaper than Katz. Definitely ask for medium or else they give you lean meat. The brisket was tender and flavorful. We also tried the fries and they gave us packets of vinegar and ketchup. I never had fries with vinegar before but it did go well. They were crispy and fresh just like the ones from Pomme Frites in NYC. I do regret not trying their poutine though. On the second visit, we experienced a HUGE line for the restaurant as well as the take out next door. Guess it really depends on what time you go. Bring cash or else they charge a 10% extra when paying with American Dollars!",real
I absolutely love this place so much that I was getting hungry and had to try the shrimp and clams..... It was a great roll with fresh made latte and shrimp scampi.  Sauce porserie and sandwiches are amazing and the meatball pizza is delicious!,fake

The only Michelin rated chinese restaurant in the country and it is well deserved. I thought to myself before coming here how could you make traditional chinese food Michelin worthy based on their menu and I can tell you know that they figured it out. The noodles were so tender and delicious the sea bass was unbelievable.  This is definitely an elegant date restaurant if you want to impress your loved one. Not a typical vegas spot but it should be.,real

"Stopped in today for my first visit.  I had recently attended a benefit dinner, and won a $25 gift certificate (called ""Maiden Money"") during the raffle, and was so excited to win it, because this place was on my list of places I wanted to try.   I knew by the photos and the reviews that I was in for some good vegan food, but what I didn't realize is that even though this place is labeled as ""Heavy Metal,"" it really wasn't a dark, dirty, screamo metal playing establishment.  I was pleasantly surprised that they were actually playing some kind of instrumental, sorta new agey, music when I walked in, which segued into some Ramones, The Smiths, Reggae, and some othe cool tunes (I didn't get a photo, but I noticed one of the Chefs had The Smiths album cover, ""Meat is Murder,"" printed on the back of her kitchen uniform (Thumbs Up for that)).  The food was totally incredible, and so delicious.  I had the tacos off of the brunch menu, which included a side of seasoned potatoes and kale, and they were fantabulous, and the tacos were great too.  For ""dessert"" I had the ""Holy Diver,"" (coincidentally named after my favorite song by Ronnie James Dio) which is the donut of the day, and today's flavor was lemon/blueberry, and along with my cup of coffee (locally roasted by Zeke's).  I had a wonderful brunch, and still had some ""Maiden Money"" left-over, so I cannot wait to come back again and try some of the other different menu items.  This place ROCKS!!!P.S.  I was also glad to see at least one gluten-free item on the menu, and since my wife is gluten-sensitive, I'll be bringing her next time too.P.P.S.  This place has the coolest gender-neutral bathrooms I've ever seen (see photos) and the bathroom w/urinal, also has a changing table for babies, so this place is good for people of all ages, and in fact the table next to me had a tiny lil' one eating some Metal-Vegan food with her parents . . . that's awesome.",real
"Definitely the best sushi bar this side of town.That being said, I wish they were a bit more traditional with their cuts.  Everything seems to be cut much thicker than it should be, notably their chashu and their sashimi.  I would much prefer having thinner slices and more pieces.",real
"Had a lovely 2 hour meal at Yasu - enjoyed the company of the other diners, and well as joking around with and asking Chef Yasu questions.

What a lovely restaurant. Service was very on the ball our whole visit. Food was amazing and filling for a great price! They have very miminal beer selection but priced can't be beat for 3.50 for domestic and 5 for henekein. My don Katsu was amazing-a giant plate of delicious flavoured meat-heaven! All that meat and a drink for 20 dollars is a great deal in my book. Especially since it came w a ton of free mini apps and rice and salad. Only comment is when I asked for soy sauce w my dish they woman gave me the sassiest look and a look of total  disappointment.. I was being kinda vanilla asking for it I get it but the reaction was kinda funny.,real

"Venezia's delivers!  I mean that in every sense of the word.  We were out looking around the area one day and found this location.  Since we had just eaten we did not stop but I put it in my memory banks for future meals.  I checked their website and found that they delivered to my area.  Yay!  There is nothing like good pizza delivery after a long day. I have ordered delivery many times from this location and each time they appear at my door in the alloted timeframe with my fresh, hot pizza exactly the way I ordered it!  I have never called them but used their online ordering system and it works like a charm.  My requests have always been fulfilled.  The delivery drivers deliver with a smile and are always courteous. As for the pizza.....YUM!  It is a New York Style pizza with lots of cheese and great, fresh toppings.  They  have Sicilian style but I'm kinda stuck on NY.  :)  They also have a children's menu.  My daughter is a picky eater and, while she like plain cheese pizza her favorite is black olives.  I can order the mini cheese and have black olives put on it for her and that works much better then getting a portion of a larger pizza for her.  She is happy having her very own little pizza.  Their salads are always fresh and crisp.  I have not tried their wings yet but I'm sure I will.  They have some great specials too.  If you are near one of their locations within their delivery area give them a try!  I'm sure I will go to this location at some point but their delivery is so great, I'm not sure when that will be.  Thank you for delivering Venezia's!!!",real

Great coffee and food. I usually go during the Winton for the wings and cheese steak and also the Manhattan chicken.  The staff was very helpful and our waitress was super cool. Thank you for a great experience and the food is always fresh and delicious.  Also the Fro Rice Bowl is one of the best sandwiches I've had in years. Best Thai food I've had in a long time.  Rick is our favorite because it is so good.  The crepes are absolutely delicious.  They're my favorite will be even better. The small plates are great for a large selection and great service. Great food and specials always have a smile on your face and they have great service and will now be our stay at South Korea for years . The food and the service excellent and the atmosphere is great. Take out only if you're going on a weekend it's a little hidden gem in a wildfinet district. The food is great.

The restaurant is in a strip mall and it's next to an adult day care center. But who cares?!!

Great bar none. They make the best risotto and fresh basil tofu. We especially enjoy their food and the service. I love this place for healthy alternatives and I go to Rosati case.

"Chick-fil-A is always good, but this location is awesome. I'd like to do a study on their training program and corporate culture and this is the location where I'd start. ""Oh, my pleasure!"" See how many times you can hear that when making an order through the drive-thru. Oh yeah, and the food is good too! I don't know what they do to the chicken breasts they make their sandwiches with, but man they are good! I'm addicted to the spicy chicken sandwich. Let's face it, nothing fried is ""healthy"" but using fresh ingredients, peanut oil (cholesterol free and no trans fats) is a good start; and they do have truly healthy offerings if you want to go that route (sorry, no waffle cut fries on that menu!)",real
"If I could give more stars I would! This spot has my two favorite things: Mac n cheese and fried chicken!! I love the way the menu is set up, very easy to understand and easy to order. You can't go wrong with anything, everything is fresh cooked to order and the signature sauce is on point! I love how the location is not super big, the food comes out fast and the owner Matt is such a sweetheart. Def have to stop by again next time I'm in Vegas!",real
You can even get a bakery! Happy hour menu is very good and so is the staff. And the food is delicious and inventive. Good job!,fake
"I have been to this place 4 times and I keep coming back, I love it. They start you off with a carafe of red and white wine and you can either choose one or drink them both, the salad is more than average with a house italian dressing along with some breadsticks. I choose lasagna this past time, which was excellent and a big portion, and my favorite part of the meal is the cappuccino at the end, you are SO full of food, but you must drink this, it is not your average drink, so good. While eating there is the cutest nicest older man strolling around and greeting you and playing his accordion for a tip (remember to tip him when he is done!) Old pictures on the wall to enjoy and cushion seats to sit on in your booth. The bathroom is interesting too, in the lady's room there is a picture on the wall that will make you laugh.  This place is a MUST GO when in Vegas.",real
"The best dinning experience I've had in a while, I usually get the Stone Crab and hot pot and It was amazing.  They took great care of us and we all agreed.  We went there very fast with my husband and we will definitely be back. I really enjoyed them and they have a great option of the product as well!",fake

"I have to agree with the ratings so many have given.....  VERY good Indian food even if you are not a big Indian food person.

Will be back to try something different soon!!",real

Delicious croissants, even after taking half to-go and eating it hours later.",real

"I will be back. Tonight was my first time here. I was with my 11 month old daughter (foodie in training) so we couldn't take advantage of the hibachi grill , which I thought would be fun. I did order steak and chicken Teppanaki (sp?) and it was hands down better than Benihana , Sapporo or any other I've been to. The food was so flavorful without being overly dressed with butter . The sushi looked yummy and the service was incredible. I will be back with a bigger crowd besides my side kick foodie in training.",real
"Maria was by far the best waitress I've ever had... Ever! She was very attentive to all of her tables and had the best attitude. Other than great service, the food of course was perfect. Real homemade Italian food! The salad was great and our pizza was called the Combo, sausage, sweet red and green bell peppers with mushroom and mozzarella on a thin crispy crust. Sooooo good! Desert not to mention was ideal! It was Maria's favorite and we decided to go with her suggestion. It was a warm apple pie that had vanilla bean ice cream on top. It was superb. I will defiantly be coming back with my family and friends. 3 thumbs up!",real
"Walked in around 1pm on a weekday and ordered the falafel plate to go. It was delicious - the falafels were nice and crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. The salad was fresh with pita chips and a tasty red seasoning sprinkled on top. It came with a large serving of humus and two full pitas! The portion was very generous, I couldn't even finish the meal. The restaurant itself was clean, colorful and bright with beautiful middle eastern decorations. The staff was courteous and my order was ready within a couple minutes. I'll definitely be back to try the other items on the menu.",real
My husband and I recently had breakfast at Butterfield's for the first time. The food was delicious especially the pancakes and bacon!  Service was good too.

"Sea is the hidden gem of the Paris/Bally's compound. The stand outs at this restaurant are the entrees, the ambiance, and the staff.We have tried many different appetizers here and have not found a favorite yet. That being said, we have tried the drunken noodle entrée, the red curry, and the green curry. Each dish is absolutely delicious. The jasmine rice is the perfect amount of sticky and is always served in generous portions.It is certainly not cheap, but it is essentially a fine dining Thai restaurant in Las Vegas, so that is to be expected. It's absolutely gorgeous inside and the hostess is the nicest person working in a Las Vegas restaurant.Ask for Grace, you won't be disappointed.",real
These guys and I love the food and attentively produce. This place is beautiful. I'm not a sandwich sandwich back though but when I die.,fake

"This is one of my go to coffee shops when I want to stay in Mesa/Gilbert area. I love studying here but for others looking for a study spot - there aren't many outlets!! And the brunch time rush on weekends can be really distracting if you're trying to get some hard core studying in, because the line will be huge! Aesthetics - this is why I come here. I love every bit of Agritopia, and The Coffee Shop is a perfect addition. Something about being here with natural light of Arizona sun flooding in just lifts my spirits. Exactly the mood booster I need when getting ready to *hit the grind* (heh pun intended) or just get brunch with a friend.Caffeine - pretty wide range of options, both coffee/tea/more!Cupcakes - I personally don't love cupcakes, but for the sake of Yelp, I took a bite of my friend's red velvet, and I have to say it was pretty good! And honestly, the display is so enticing I actually think about ordering the desserts even though I don't have a huge huge sweet tooth. Everyone I know enjoys it though, so definitely worth a try! (Especially bc they were featured in Cupcake Wars!!!)Food - every time I come, I have a dilemma with what to order because everything looks so good and FRESH. I got the Turkey and Havarti sandwich the first time and loved it so much I sometimes have cravings for it. Next time though, I'll be sure to try more of their options - because there will certainly be many more next times to come!",real
This place is amazing  I can count on a healthy side of meeting a date at night.  The food is great and has a new restaurant to come and enjoy the last bite!,fake

Everything was so delicious! Service was excellent and the food matched the other tea.   We will definitely be back!,fake
This place is awesome! One side has a DJ and a pool table with specialty beers you can order by name or number. The other side has a stage and live bands so you are just a door away from choosing which kind of atmosphere you would like. A mixed crowd of people but everyone for the most part seem to enjoy themselves. In the few times I have been there I have not seen any incidents there.The place has character for sure and drinks are reasonable. Well worth the look. My only gripe is the bathroom is single toilet and not so nice but I still give it 5 stars because everything else is so good.,real
This is by far the best BBQ in the City!  Their food is even more authentic and tastes sooo good!!  We will be back!,fake
Awesome home cooked food. We loved the burger! Highly recommended!,fake

"I don't know why there are so many bad reviews people need to stop associating this new place(Meat Chix) with the old one(Chicken Bonz) i mean it was good but this place is better being its great food and amazing service, we had the Bourbon burger and the all american burger and it was AMAZING the meat tasted so delicious and just like steak between two amazing buns and fresh veggies, we also had the potato chips the seasoning on those were great also with the apple Cole slaw it was GREAT and that is just the food I am talking about not the desert.we ordered the Fried Ice cream and the Fried Oreo's and well let me tell you they did not last very long they were both super DELICIOUS. no matter what other people say i will always keep coming back people that give bad reviews maybe they are just un-happy with themselves or had something to do with Chicken Bonz, but if they had a 10 star i would give this place 11 so its a great spot and the music is amazing I recommend it to everyone!!!!!",real
I got the grilled cheese sandwich and the lobster bisque.  Highly recommend. The local beer selection is huge.,fake
"Came in on a Monday for a late dinner. Split a delightful bottle of red wine (half off on Mondays!) with my husband.  The duck was absolutely out of this world -- as good as I've had anywhere. Perfectly seared, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  I would make a special trip just to have that dish again.  My husband had the elk (medium rare), simply delicious -- cooked perfectly.  I don't have elk often, and this was a standout example.Because it was late, they were out of a few of the more popular items, like the wild boar. So if you have your heart on something, get there early!Extra points for the service as well.  We arrived slightly before our reservation and the hostess was good enough to ask us if we'd like to be seated immediately or wait a few minutes for a better table. All in all, a fantastic and truly memorable meal. Worth the trip.",real
"Stopped in for a few drinks before meeting my sister for a  shopping date. I had the cucumber jalapeño margarita and it was amazing!  I've tried and can't copy these at home. Guess I'll just have to keep coming back. Even their chips and salsa are amazing. I haven't tried their food yet but if their food is as good as their margaritas, I'm sure I won't be disappointed.",real

"I went around 11:00am and ordered a large Cherry Nerd slushy, a large Mango Iced Tea and three chicken strips sandwiches. There was only one other car and they sort of took a long time. The chicken strip sandwiches where made perfectly not sloppy and they came with like 3-4 stripes of chicken which is pretty good for $1.49. The slushy was sort of melted but it was delicious and the Mango tea I took a sip of it (not for me) and it tasted sweet and good. The service was good but not fast just normal I guess. The cashier was nice and not rude. The waiter in the roller skates was nice too. Everything was awesome and no complaints.",real
My favorite sushi place in Vegas! Bee soup is delicious and the sides are always fresh.,fake
The BBQ sauce is so good! I was in the area and this is the best place to eat in Pittsburgh.,fake
"Good heavens. This place is AMAZING. I cannot adequately describe the unexpectedly delicious combinations of flavors in the dishes I tried today, in their red curry and pad Thai. I'm a big fan of Thai food, but this chef really had a gift. The red curry had a stronger basil taste than I am used to, and it melded perfectly with the spiciness, nuttiness, and light sweetness and bitterness of the dish. I normally order a 4 on the spiciness scale when I get Thai food, but I had read other reviews that said this place is on the spicy side. I played it safe, and got a 3 for the red curry and a 2 for the pad Thai, and was very happy with what I got. The pad Thai is unlike other versions of the dish I have tried, in that this chef's version has more tartness, which was a very pleasant complement to the curry. And once I literally could eat no more, after being reduced to the ""just one more bite"" mentality multiple times, they brought out free, delicious, homemade ice cream. I'm going to be raving about this place for a while. If I ever visit Phoenix again, I will most certainly be back!",real
"Next time I visit Las Vegas we are definitely visiting for either lunch or dinner--excellent meals (I sampled my whole family's dishes), friendly and professional service.  I had the farm toast, my husband had the Biloxi chicken sandwich, and my daughter had a delicious salad.  All farm fresh.  We were very impressed that it is local and fresh.  They even grow lettuces right in the  restaurant!!  Be sure to try the salt scrub soaps too!",real
Love this place! We go to vegas a lot and always  am looking for a good breakfast place and have finally found one!

"My wife and I love this ""hidden gem""! Brett is an amazing bar tender and Rick, the manager is constantly engaged with his customers! The food is always wonderful and the portion size is perfect. The drinks a great too! We love the fact that they have live entertainment on the weekends and the small dance floor gets crowded. This is definitely our ""go to "" when we are on that side of town. We really enjoy their other lounge ""VB Lounge"", which is closer to where we live. Bother worth checking out! Cheers!",real
My favorite burrito place in Charlotte! I'm never disappointed.,fake

Three of us dined this past Monday night and it was a bit slow so we rec'd extra special attention from the waiter.We had the fried burrata and crisp pancetta wrapped prawns.  So yummy and succulent.  Let me talk about the baby beet salad. OHMYGAWD!  I will dream of this special salad forever.  I've never seen orange beets but simply de-lish.  Also, we had the scallops, salmon, and claim pasta.  Just gorg food and ever so good.I absolutely love this place.  Go.  There.  Now.",real

Atmosphere is great, service is super and the food was tasty, prepared to order and perfect portion size. Great little extras - like Pecan Cole Slaw - who would've thunk. I ordered the ribeye steak and it was cooked exactly to order delivered with great sides. Great beer selection on tap and those donuts - warm, soft, sweet donuts. My only regret is that I didn't go sooner or more often on my trip. I'll be back!",real

"Myself and 3 other friends recently ate at Franco's in Old Town.  From the moment we sat down it felt like I was back in my grandma's kitchen.  Everything on the menu sounded incredible and from surveying the other patrons and the smiles on their faces we knew the food was going to be great. However, deciding what to order was becoming challenging until my girlfriend suggested we order family style. Our waiter, Antonio, was more than happy to accommodate our request. We ordered the lamb chops, veal, sea bass and a pasta trio.  Needless to say the food quality and presentation were absolutely incredible. For desert, we went old school Italian, cheeses and fruit accompanied by cappuccinos for everybody.  Once again, simply delightful. I do believe I have found my new favorite ""go to"" restaurant in Scottsdale.",real
Absolutely more than the best pizza I've ever had and the service is excellent. The music is nice and cozy as well. The coffee was good and the service was efficient! We will definitely return!!,fake

"I am very selective about my 5-Star ratings and am exceptionally happy to add one more to this short list.I went to Bardot while staying at the Aria hotel/resort.  I honestly didn't think much of the typical fancy places in Vegas, which is maybe why Bardot was such a revelation.  Most of the fancy places are all decor and no real substance.  Bardot was the rare exception.  If I go back to Vegas, I'll be sure to dine there every night.Bardot has your typical French decor: Beautiful tiled floor, lots of brass at the bar, and elegant seating.  Along with that decor comes a great bar and great bartenders.  These folks are genuinely happy to see you.  The customer service here is second to none.  Bartenders are experienced and knowledgable on all beers and spirits.  I tried a few beers before deciding that Hors D'age was going to be the one.  I highly recommend it, especially considering that you can only get it at Mina restaurants (or so I was told).The food?  Delicious!  If you go for brunch, challenge yourself to finish the french toast.  It's like nothing you've ever had before.  Close to half a loaf, this delicious piece of heaven comes with a fantastic almond syrup thing that enhances the experience.You've read enough of my rattling, go and try it.  You will not be disappointed.",real

Music to the bride's ears!! Service was first class as well. The Whale appetizer was impressive - lobster tails, crab, shrimp and ceviche. Highly recommend!!! The steaks were cooked perfectly and the Chilean Sea Bass is a must. Jessica H. was great to work with in planning the event. She was responsive to our questions and designed a beautiful menu. Thank you, Joe's!!",real
"I have no idea why AG is not rated 5 stars... because it completely desrves it.I have tried several expensive steak houses (Flemings, Ruths Chris, Harris', etc.), but none compares to Arrowhead Grill.  They are moderately priced-- you have to expect to pay some money for a great steak, so those who complain about it being too expensive obviously didn't know what they were getting into.  The filet mignon and 10 oz. Delmonico are both OUTSTANDING.  Never a need for ANY steak sauce.Because I like so many things here, I will just list them.  Pretzel appetizer (very cheap considering the menu), trio of fries, chicken tacos appetizer, chili mac n cheese, loaded baked potato, carmelized onions, strawberry and chocolate fondue, key lime pie, creme brulee.  ALL are great.This is a true steak restaurant, so all sides are served a la carte.",real

After reading the other reviews I will have to disagree with most of you that where not satisfied as I am writing this 15 minutes after destroying a pulled pork burrito I have had pulled pork in the Texas and Missouri area of the united states and I must say that this pulled pork can sit in the best of the mid west even though it's from Montreal I highly recommend this place and don't listen the the people that spit that Tom foolery about this place my stars don't lie 5/5,real
I absolutely love this place. I got the Greek salad and the Mac and cheese sandwich with beef on sitting.,fake
"I read a description of Sutter's as ""a diamond in the rough"".  I couldn't agree more.For most Clevelanders, Sutter's is not conveniently located. Several years ago they were originally located on E. 140th Street in Cleveland. They closed for a few years and reopened in Newbury - way out in the deep, dark depths of Geauga county. You will not regret taking the drive to eat here, that is, if you're willing to eat veal. My parents have been regulars at this restaurant for nearly 30 years. They were really sad when the original location closed. My dad thinks he's cool because he can walk back into the kitchen and talk to John (owner and chef) and buy him a drink while he cooks.The menu consists mostly of veal dishes and some really great appetizers. Steamed mussels in a tomato sauce, giant stuffed mushrooms, sauerkraut meatballs. The mussels are a must try. My brother took a mussel shell and actually drank some of the sauce they were prepared in. We are a classy family.I am not afraid to say that Sutter's serves the best schnitzel and scallopini dishes you will find in northeast Ohio, period.  The potato pancakes are to die for. I went last night with a party of 12 REALLY LOUD Italian people. When our entrees arrived there was complete silence - we were all eating and could not be bothered to speak. There was an occasional ""nom"" here and there. If you're not into veal (I understand, I refused to eat it for years), they offer a few fish dishes, pasta, and chicken. The portions are seriously huge. If you are like me, you will eat maybe 1/4 of your entree. You will leave with leftovers and they will be just as delicious tomorrow. If you're planning a visit to Sutter's on the weekend, I would suggest making a reservation. Also, sadly there was talk last night of the owners wanting to retire so they may not be around much longer.",real

"For a while, my sushi squad (it's okay to laugh) were coming here weekly - yep, it's that good. Oyshi is super clean, has a chill atmosphere and a friendly staff who are quite accomodating. The menu is chock-full  of deliciousness - and you'll find something for everyone, even the non-adventurous. I love the nigiri here - perfect portion size. The ahi poke bowl is great, and I love that they've got it on the all you can eat menu, whereas most places will only permit one per person. We always get a ton of nigiri and a few of the skirt steaks, cuz they are a sizzling plate of yum that can't be resisted. Chef Daniel was our absolute favorite, so you could count on us occupying a large booth in the back every Friday night. Since he has moved on, we hit this place up at least once per month - as some things have changed, which is a bummer - but it's overall still a great spot. Room for improvement here would be the hot tea. They give you an entire pot (which is rad!) but because the tea leaves are left to steep, it's oftentimes incredibly bitter by the middle/end of the pot, which makes me sad. You know we'll be back. Every other Friday for the rest of eternity :)",real
"Killer.  Great salsa, chips and stuff.  Packed on a Friday 7pm.  30 min wait....but well worth it.  Bar area was busy and looks like a good spot to hang out and watch the game.Had the....Beef fajitas - amazing.Cheese enchiladas - awesome.

I like this place. I go once a week and so far. Their delicious breakfast is terrific. The prices are reasonable. We can tell five stars for the food and the service. Best sandwich place ever,fake
"I walk in, and the place is PACKED. I'm like daaamn business is booming lol the wait was about 10 mins. The lady was about to seat us totally totally in the corner next to a seat two other people were next to and I felt it'd be awkward since the whole row was literally empty and sitting next to these people in the corner would be a really awkward dinner hearing both groups conversations so I asked the lady to be seated somewhere on the empty row and she seats us on the other end next to where they put all the dirty grills since supposedly a 6 person party was supposed to sit next to us (but they never even showed up until closing!) anyways. Our server was Eugene and he had probably the best customer service than anywhere I've ever been! He constantly made sure we had napkins, sesame oil, orders in, grills changed, and etc. basically his customer service totally made up for the host trying to put us in the horrible corner. Now The food, the meat all tastes like way better quality than honey pig, or even some of the korean BBQ on the southwest side of Vegas. I didn't get really bad indigestion from eating here versus any other korean restaurant. The only thing that's possibly different is their sesame oil, it doesn't taste that great with my pork belly versus other places, and their spicy tofu soup lacks a bit of authenticity but other than that; they also have Cajun shrimps you can grill and a huge variety of meat selections I mean so it makes up for it. I'd give this place a solid 4 stars but our server Eugene was so awesome I have to give 5 stars. I'd def recommend or probably bring all my friends here if we have time to drive across town",real
Fantastic coffee and delicious vegan coffee. We have been here several times and always have anotee love that they are one of the few places that allow meat items on the menu and the bread that comes with the dark meat. All I can say is yum!! We will definitely be back!!!!,fake

Can't say enough good things about this place, it's clean, the staff is friendly and the food is great!",real
"Been here a few times and got the spicy seafood chanpon and it's great every time. It's always consistent in taste and never disappoints. Every time I get the craving of seafood in a spicy creamy broth, I go to Mamaoh. They don't skimp on the seafood nor do they on the portion. The picture on the menu may seem small but the bowl they give is very fulfillingThe service is phenomenal, there was something wrong with one of my orders (only happened once) and they remade me a new order in a heartbeat. Not only did they do that, the waitress called the manager and the manager gave 10% off my total bill. That was an unnecessary kind gesture when they already fixed my problem. I hope everyone who comes here walk out as happy as I did. Will be becoming a regular!",real

Come here for the EMPANADAS!!!!  The food is good- but the empanadas are AMAZING!   When I came here- I was planning on taking a photo of the food to post- but it didn't last long enough for me to do that.  I highly recommend the pumpkin and/or pineapple empanadas.

"Just on the basis that this place has the most incredible cheese pizza on the planet, and I usually don't order plain cheese, I give them a 5. The rest of their menu has been hit and miss for me, but dagnabbit, this IS a pizza place and I cannot get enough of their cheese pizza. Did I mention the cheese pizza? A perfect blend of cheeses, with a wonderfully home made sauce that's so yummy. I don't make any special requests but the service is always friendly and excellent, so I'd be certain that if you ask for more or less sauce they would readily oblige.",real

Even though it is counter service, he brought us our food and came and checked on us after we had eaten a few bites. I will be going here again.",real
"This rating is only representative of the chocolate macaroons.  As a chocolate lover these are awesome.  Great deep rich chocolate flavor without being overly sweet.  The texture is perfect as well as the outer shell is light and crunchy, the inside is soft and chewy with a beautiful chocolate center.I always get macaroons whenever I see them and this place has the best.  Further, these are almost twice as big as regular macaroons.  Always, ALWAYS get a box of 6 because you get 1 free as it helps to alleviate the price a little even though macaroons are pricey everywhere (even for small ones).I've also gotten the 3 pack of chocolate chip cookies and they were great also...good chocolate flavor and a nice texture.  The first time we tried the macaroons, we tried almost all the flavors...the other flavors were OK, but I can't recall any single flavor standing out except chocolate.  Every subsequent trip to Bouchon has consisted of only the chocolate macaroons.The ironic part is that there is a Bouchon in Beverly Hills but we never go when we are there, it's almost as if it's a Vegas tradition for us.In a city where desserts at buffets are rampant and way too sweet, these chocolate macaroons are the best treat around.",real

I'm pretty picky when it comes to sushi but this place rocks my world. Super picky about Tako specifically and here it tastes awesome. Not fishy at all a the texture is just right.

"You ever have an experience where in the middle of it, you realize that you are at the pinnacle - the zenith - of that particular type of experience?  It was my last night in Phoenix and hap and circumstance led us to Barrio Cafe.  My Karma must be fabulous right now, as I tell you without hyperbole that it was the best meal I have ever had.Filet mignon topped with Mexican crab meat and goat cheese coupled with two top shelf margaritas. I almost balked as I think the margaritas were $9 and the steak $25-ish (more than I'm usually inclined to spend) but hey - last night of the vacation so why not.I tried to savor it, but I just wanted to gorge myself on it.  It was so tasty that words fail me.  I know that some day if I find myself on death row, this is the meal I will request.  I will not be surprised if the sheer ecstasy of the meal kills me first.",real

It's much cheaper, and worth every single penny!",real
"We decided on trying out Burgerim this evening. We were kinda tired so we wanted to get it to go. We walked in and placed our order. There are many different proteins to choose from along with toppings. Since it was our first time, we just ordered the beef burgers however we did all get different sides to try (Burgerim Fries, Sweet Potato, Slim Fries and Onion Rings). To be honest it did take a while for our food to get out to us. Maybe because they cook everything to-order or because it was a Saturday night and they just opened? But once the food came out it smelled delicious. Once we got home we tore into everything. We ended up getting 2 Trio Combos, 1 Double Combo and a Kids Meal. We ate everything! My little one who normally takes her time eating, ate all of hers and wanted more. The Burgers were super fresh and juicy. The fries (Burgerim) were awesome. Basically a mix between fries and chips. The crunchy ones were like thick chips and the soft ones were like flat French fries. We all like our fries and consider ourselves fry connoisseurs and they were delicious. The price is to be as expected since you are getting higher quality food. I would say average around $10-$12 per person and it's more than enough food. Over all our meal was great and we will return another day.",real
The crepes here are fabulous! The nutella chocolate one is a great dessert w/ a cafe mocha on the side. All the small desserts are great and the price isn't too steep for being on the Strip.,real

My friends and I purchased a large variety of pastries for our trip home to Boston. My friend even purchased extra pastries to overnight-ship to her family in Utah, knowing that they would love them. The character buns were the cutest thing!",real

Although the kitchen closes at 12AM,   they still open until 2AM. Great friendly staff, always welcoming, but service may not be the best if you are in a hurry.",real
"stumbled upon this place visiting Canada's wonderland, and we fell in love immediatly. we live downtown so it's a trek to get out there since we don't have a car. but anytime we are going in that direction we  stock up on chicken.  The sauce, the potatoes, the rice, and the moist chicken, all so good.",real
This place is a gem! I have eaten Thai food all over the USA and this place is great. The shopping center is not so great; but inside is very clean and modern. If your staying north on the strip...take Uber here!!!!Portions are large enough to split too....,real
"Favorite restaurant in AZ.  Their filet mignon is amazing!  My daughter has food allergies and the wait staff is so wonderful, they will literally bring me ingredient labels even going as far as to cut the label off a box for me so I can read it myself.  Love their brownie al a mode too!! Omg!!",real
The only downside is this place is definitely not good at hello options than other places I have ever been to in downtown Phoenix. The food is amazing and the prices are low.  The atmosphere is attached to the other places that you just can't compare any time but definitely worth the money!!!,fake
"OMG I'M IN LOVE WITH THIS PLACE!Btw, Did I mention that Julia Baker is amazing? I didnt? Well SHE IS. So down to earth with a great sense of humor! She definitely has an interesting life story. I think this is a great place at the Biltmore to stop by for a bit of indulgence in chocolate, girl talk and espresso. They offer free wifi, which is great if you want to stop by and do some surfing of the web. If I lived in the area, I would stop by here to do homework. The ambiance is girly, but very European as well. Very similar to how I would view a cafe in France. The chocolates here can be a little pricey, but they are to die for. I would suggest the red velvet cake dipped in dark chocolate. Its amazing. I'll be stopping here every time I come to  Biltmore Fashion Park!",real

"It IS possible to have great sushi in Toronto!Nami set the bar for all my dining experiences in Toronto and was hard to top.  When you enter the restaurant, you'll be confronted by a samurai warrior.  Not a real one, it was just a costume, but beside it you'll be greeted by a friendly Japanese hostess dressed in a traditional kimono.  So far so good.  The Sushi Pizza was recommended to me a few time from friends so I had to order it.  Salmon sashimi topped with spicy sauce and roe on top of deep fried rice.  The combination and textures went together very well.  All other nigiri and sushi I ordered were fresh and high quality.  As my husband and I ate, there was soft music playing in the background.  I know it was a CD, but I imagined a harp being played behind one of the screen doors while a geisha danced to the music.  The service throughout our whole meal was fantastic and we'll be back again.",real
"I gotta say this is my favorite in N out location. I come here often maybe once a week. Great customer service,  this place tends to get busy but their still very nice and fast.

"Great food, great staff, and very good service. I am known as I forgot to pay more for the crowd, but we were seated immediately. The cook was very surprised to find a sushi bar period. Went on a Monday night...  Very good food, fast service.  The broth was amazing.   Fantastic portions and the beer on tap was comparable.  Definitely will be coming back here regularly.",fake

"When I lived in Washington DC, I was a Dean and a Deluca regular so I was delighted to see one in Charlotte. The layout of the store is great! The dry food products are in the front. The deli, prepared foods, and pastries are on the perimeter and seating is in the middle. It felt very comfortable because there was plenty of seating inside and outside. The only issue is the parking. Parking can get really full especially on a Sunday but there is parking on the opposite side near the movie theatre. Service was amazing as always like at their other locations. Definitely stop by if you're in Charlotte because the next closest location is Washington DC!",real
"This is a shout out to Devon, who is a superb server and person all around!! During the time of my visit. I was studying for my nursing state boards and met up with a couple of gal pals. As we were getting close to our scheduled exam dates, our nervousness and emotions were moderate and we were restless with lack of sleep from ongoing studying and focusing. Devon, who was a brand new server at the time immediately greeted us cheerfully. He has a natural gift of creating laughter and right timing too!  He had us LAUGHING throughout our stay and I remember asking Devon for lemon for my water, he shortly comes out and serves me a whole uncut lemon and I, along with my peers looked at each other and looked at Devon and were like what? He broke a smile and we all laughed out loud! He had some other entertaining quirks and he was fantastic as a server throughout our dining experience that I had inquired why he was in training? He needed to fly solo and I believe he has a future in management. I went ahead and spoke to the iHOP manager to genuinely express positive feedback about Devon and assured that he can serve on his own and perhaps train others. Continue your good nature and demeanor Devon. We appreciate you!! May your personality spread to many. You really do make a difference!  I look forward to enjoying another dine in experience as long as you are serving or are management! :)",real
"David Chang is my hero. Momofuku is everything he embodies. Innovation, back to the basics, and honestly good food with a little mad scientist. The ramen was perfectly al dente and alkaline. Broth was piping hot as it should be. Truffle ramen, chick pea miso ramen, and the classic pork belly tori paitan style ramen- all perfect and so unique in their own ways.There are also very good appetizers like the spicy cucumber and baos. I highly recommend the cucumbers. There's an excellent balance of acidity, sweet fresh cucumber, roasted almond, and a little bit of heat. The baos are just always awesome, too. The prices here are a bit steep for what you think you're ordering,  but that's just Vegas+David Chang. Outs width it to splurge now and then!Don't forget to try the deserts. You can either go to milk bar next door, or order from the table!",real
"Osaka is, hands down, my favorite sushi restaurant in Las Vegas (and in the last 10 years, we have frequented quite a few). They have excellent fish (top quality, all the time), reasonable prices, and a smaller, quiet sushi bar that is very easy to enjoy a meal at with your family. They also have a dining room with tables, and tatami rooms in the back, where I would personally love to go for a birthday dinner. It's about 10-15 minutes off the strip, and in my opinion totally worth it whether you're a local or in town for vacation. One of the best bonuses about Osaka is their hours- they are open for lunch and super late (until 2:00 am!!!). Some ordering recommendations- - My number one recommendation is simply for the nigiri sushi. I personally have never had a bad experience with their sake or hamachi, and when they say the uni is good, it's really good! I also like their regular-old spicy tuna roll. - Our family's go-to rolls generally include the O.G. Special (crispy rice with spicy tuna and yummy sauce + sriracha on top) and Kai's Special roll. Both are always hits with visitors too. - From the kitchen, I personally like the Osaka Rice (sushi rice, masago, crab, sauce). Our family is split between the empura soft shell crab with ponzu sauce and the soft shell katsu with screaming sauce- both are a great appetizer to split.",real
"This is my first time at Bahn Mi & Ti. The restaurant was busy but the friendly staff waited on me right away and my order was ready in a short period of time. A friend recommended I try the Drunken Beef and although I rarely eat beef the sandwich wasn't a disappointment.  The baguette roll is slightly crunchy on the outside and soft inside, the beef was tender and the picked vegetables, homemade mayo and sweet onions were the perfect accompaniment. If you like a spicy kick try putting some of the jalapeños. You can use Apple and Samsung pay too! I will visit the eatery again!",real

"I wanted to go to Chicago.... but plane tickets are ridiculous.... low and behold I end up at a Chicago pizza eatery to drown my broken dreams in cheesy grease and saucy crust..... I walk up to a mall I had been to several times to find a hidden gem in the corner.... the hidden pepperoni on the pizza.... the saucy sauce of all sauces.... my family is waiting for me on the patio and come running up to me in their Italian Chicago embrace so happy to be in a place that feels like a slice of home. We order the deepest of deep dish pizzas- and were greeted with the largest pizza pie of cheesy saucy goodness my eyes have beheld. And boom with one bite upon my fragile taste buds into the endless sauce abyss--- there I was in Chicago- back in the bustling town eating a favorite slice of my Chicago pizza.... so thank you Lou Malnatis for giving me a traditional slice of deep dish pizza- and for being cheaper than a plane ticket.... yummy food, fun environment and atmosphere, and for letting me gorge myself on your cheesy cheesy goodness",real

"Holy f**k their sandwiches are pretty damn good! I touched down in Vegas last Thursday around 2PM and I was f**king hungry. Since my friends and I were staying in Paris, I remember this place had opened up in Planet Hollywood, but I never got around to going. Thanks to Jeffrey L. and Clarisse C., I was reminded of this place too. So I made the short walk from Paris to try this out. I liked the fact that the line wasn't long at all, but there were a fair amount of customers. For a little over 6 bucks, I started off with the Montagu. I also like the efficiency on how orders are made, with the two separate order/pickup sections, and the ability to see your sandwich being made. Little did I know that this sandwich would pack a lot of flavor. There was a fair portion of ingredients in between the bread, and the bread itself was perfectly baked. I savored every bite, but apparently I enjoyed this place so much I ended up buying 7 sandwiches over the course of the weekend, 2 of them which I brought home that following Sunday. Over the weekend, I also tried the Italian/Scudetto and the club. I really think any sandwich here will hit the spot. You also get your money's worth, and for Vegas, its kinda cheap. Who needs the buffets? Actually, I do like buffets, but Earl's is the spot to go when you're on a budget. Try this place for the bread alone. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Though I wish they had a location in the Bay Area, I like its exclusivity and I also would like to preserve its novelty. Word. Cheerio.",real
I went here for the first time today and it was amazing. The service was awesome! Definitely dine in here and getting the beer float sents in returning too!,fake
"Authentic Hong Kong style noodles and chinese bbq!!  Everything we ordered was fabulous!!  What we loved the most, as other yelpers have already pointed out, is their roast pork.  The skin was perfectly crispy, but not too hard and crunchy like some other restaurants.   The meat was perfectly seasoned and very tender.  Some places might have decent skin, but the meat may come out tough, dry, or bland.  This place literally perfected their roast pork!!  The roast duck was also notable.  It was very flavorful and had slightly crispy skin on.  The char siu, although decent, was our least favorite.  All our noodle dishes were very good.  I loved their pork intestine, beef innards, and wontons.  The noodles itself had really good texture to it -- slightly ""bouncy"" like how HK style noodles should be.  The broth was good also, although I've had better elsewhere since it lacked some depth.  Even as busy as they were, they were able to provide excellent service to us.  This is a difficult quality to find in a Chinese restaurant, especially where I'm from.  We enjoyed this place so much that I had to come back on my last day of vacation to pick up some takeout for our flight back!!",real

I had Chicken Cesar salad and my husband ordered the buffalo chicken spring rolls, and the veggie chicken and beef strips are to die for!!!!  Also, the owner is always there and their version of the bar ruined me with a bottle of wine and a Banh Mi which was very good too. Also, the people are friendly!

"People, save your time and money. Skip Bellagio; eat at Wynn. Let me do a side-by-side comparison:Bellagio: souplantation-ish salad bar. Wynn: gourmet salad bar, including make your own and pre-maid salads in adorable, chic cups. Bellagio: overdone fruit station with out of season, flavorless fruitsWynn: gourmet fruit and cheese bar, gourmet cold cut bar (salamis, proscuittos, cheeses, figs, apricots, etc)Bellagio: rare/bloody unseasoned prime ribWynn: herb crusted prime rib, cooked to perfection, with the delicious taste of fresh herbs and garlic still lingeringBellagio: BBQ beef brisket swimming in salty A1 sauceWynn: Rib of Veal, so tender it's practically falling off the bone.Bellagio: snow crabWynn: king crabBellagio: soft serveWynn: crepes made to order and a gelato bar. A whole separate room for dessert. Overall, this buffet is classy, clean, gorgeous. The foods are laid out around the permiter so you don't feel like a cow going from station to station, you can simply gracefully wander around the room (and everything is clearly labeled to catch your attention).  Service is excellent. If you ask for coffee, you will get a carafe of it; if you ask for juice, you'll get a pitcher of fresh squeezed oj. Noise level is low for a buffet. Prices high, but you're getting quality food. Their ethnic selection is fabulous (the best sweet & sour shrimp and tandoori mahi mahi I've ever had).Overall, this is a fantastic buffet. The best there is. Apparently this is how good the Bellagio's buffet was before Steve Wynn sold Bellagio to the MGM/Mirage group. For shame.",real
"Hello,My name is Jeff Wieland. I am the service director at Audi North Scottsdale. I used to be next door at BMW as well, for a combined 10 years of time here at the complex. In the last several years, I have used you guys for everything I needed , personal, or for business. The food has always been outstanding.  There was however a short time where the service didn't represent the Barros name very well. I wanted to let you know that those days are over. Your store is hands down the best ran, most friendly , helpful and delicious Barros pizza in the valley. I exclusively use you for all of our corporate orders. One of the reason  I believe for the positive swing is Mitch. He has been a life saver. When I forget to order until the last minute and he makes it happen, or knowing my order before i mention it, are just a few of the reasons he is a true assert to your business. Thanks again for you time.",real

"It was love at first bite. I was in the neighborhood and finally got the chance to check Suzuya out. The place was pretty busy, but luckily that gave me ample time to peruse the display case and figure out what I wanted to order. I couldn't resist the strawberry crepe cake and a red bean cream puff for my fella. The ordering and payment process is very convenient and I was out the door in minimal time with my adorable little box of desserts. I made it as far as my car before I was compelled to take a bite of the crepe cake. Holy cow! It was absolutely amazing. The flavors were so subtle and yet explosive. The flavors were right on and I can't believe it took me as long as it did to give them a try. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but this place truly blew my mind. Not overly sweet and the all-natural flavors really shown. I heard after the fact that the crepe cake is hard to come by, only making me wish I had bought more than one when I had the chance. Have no fear, I will be back... and soon.",real
"Steamed, hot snow crab with drawn butter is a winner! Having a choice of consuming hot or cold crab is a great idea. Must taste gelato flavors - mandarin yuzu, gluten free pistachio, pumpkin, peanut butter w/ chocolate pretzel are delicious!

Then we had a few roll by then the scarring that occurred from the fat bikini was gone. But we stayed for dessert - fried tempura cheesecake and deep fried ice cream.",real

"Amazing! Delicious, fast, Vietnamese sandwiches for only $4-5? I was only in town for a week and came here twice because it was so good. Both the grilled chicken and pork sandwiches were fantastic.They're really busy on weekdays around lunchtime. Less so closer to evening time. Either way the wait is never more than 10 minutes. Their system's very efficient - the first employee will take your order and send it down an assembly line to be ready for you as soon as you pay! They also offer dim sum type snacks, and other Asian foods like noodle soup, but 90% of people stick with the sandwiches. They also have milk tea, but I did not get the chance to try it.Conveniently located right across the street from Mcgill, so lots of students get lunch here. Very clean, nice place.

"I'd like to make my deep love for El Burro known. I would write love letters to these incredible tacos if I wasn't fearful of spilling salsa on them. What a fantastic neighborhood find, thanks again to Yelp!Lots of vegetarian choices and variations of those choices. The potato tacos are mouth watering, with flaky flour tortillas, fresh veggies, and chunks of potatoes cooked in some magical spice that makes me crave them nightly. The rolled potato tacos are a surprisingly huge portion of 4 taquito type goodies with loads of cheese and fresh pico. There are tons of different burrito options, I think 11 in all, many vegetarian or having veggie friendly possibilities. Oh, and some have french fries, which makes my inner fat kid squeal with delight and feel naughty at the same time. I adore that they have vegan chorizo and the breakfast burrito is definitely worth tasting, even though those potato tacos are difficult to pass up! El Burro has the best salsa I've ever tasted. I guess this is controversial since other reviewers seem to find it too thin or even runny. I don't care about chunks, apparently, just flavor. And this stuff has it! Perfect amount of kick to compliment those homemade chips. The guacamole is good, although they don't give you much of it on the side. They carry Mexican Coke (sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup) and other south of the border bottled beverages which only adds to the El Burro vibe and experience.This is primarily a take out joint, although I suppose you could eat there if you wanted. There just isn't much seating, just a handful of stools at a couple counters. Order at the counter or call ahead. The staff is super friendly and knowledgable. And it's cheap! $2.95 per taco, $5-$6 for rolled tacos, $6.95 for burritos, $2.95 for chips and a huge container of salsa. I'm so delighted to have El Burro as my new neighbor. Definitely crave-worthy food has come to Federal Street, and I could not be happier!",real

"So charming! I've never done anything like this before! I came with a group of ladies for my friend's Bachelorette Party. We each got our own little pot of tea, and the china was so cute! I was never really into playing tea party when I was a little girl, but this was so fun! Our servers were wonderful and patient, since none of us had ever visited before. They explained all the different types of tea and answered all of our questions. I know it's August, but I ordered the pumpkin spice tea. It was so yummy and got me in the mood for fall! Our party also got little samplers of sandwiches, fruit, and desserts. The chicken salad was amazing and I think my favorite treat was the scone. It was cinnamon and was perfect for dipping into my tea! I am not from the area so I doubt I will ever be able to come back to this place, but I highly recommend it for a fun afternoon!",real

It is soooooooooooooo full of sugar and all things yummy that make the perfect donut..perfect vegan donut!I love how I walked in and felt like I was back in the 90's walking into a Dunkin Donuts as a five year old kid looking for a donut with sprinkles and or maybe a donut hole (munchkin') or two.  I asked the woman working behind the counter which donuts were vegan and she pointed to a HUGE selection.  I settled for a classic jelly filled donut, a maple glazed donut (bigger than my face..my face is rather big), and  a dozen donut holes.  All 3 were spot on and not pining for any ingredient or flavor.  I was taken back to my youth for sure.I walked away 10 pounds heavier in spirit.. and in reality.  To be fair I was sharing with a friend..heh.. or maybe just overly happy with the options.  Whatever.  Vacation. The service fast and friendly.  The parking was easy peasy.  I need to visit Las Vegas again soon to consume more donuts from Ronald's Donuts and then entertain myself at Miss Britney Jean Spears' Piece of Me show by dancing to all her hits and burning off all the excess calories I'll consume that day.",real

It's worth the wait at the door! And all the servers were super nice",real
"I was hesitant to try this place because I'm used to going to my regular spots..reason for, is because everytime I go out and try something new, it just never appeals to me, for example, bad service and terrible food even with awesome reviews about those places. So I took a risk and tried this joint out..the place was very subtle and the ambience was relaxing. The server was very attentive and always came to our table at the right time we needed him. Now to the food. The nigiri was super fresh, with the right amount of rice and the appetizers were incredible. The must have are the salmon cheese stick, sizzling pork belly on a skillet, and soft shell crab just to name a few..the rolls were very delicious, great texture and flavors..oh! And you can order half rolls as well so that really got me loving this place even more! So in conclusion, I highly recommend this place and I will definitely be back soon!! Peeeeace!!",real

From the moment you walk in you'll notice an attention to detail absent from most restaurant establishments.  Service is A plus.  For starters the bread is outstanding.  Appetizers consisted of a kale salad which quite frankly may have been the best salad I ever had.  The boneless ribeye was excellent and the sides to die for.  My only complaint (and it's not really a complaint but rather an observation) is the Steaks are a bit large.  My right steak was 18 oz.  a friend of mine ordered the 42 oz porterhouse and yes, he finished it all.  Later he was in a ""food coma"" but that's another story.

My Girlfriend and I have pretty much been to every high end steakhouse in town Joe's is here new favorite spot!  The bone-in Filet started at Joe's and is the still the best @ Joe's. We had a shrimp cocktail that was great. All the sides are great, all the pies and desserts are great, especially the banana cream pie!  Also, for what we got the prices are fairly reasonable compared to comparable places like the palm or Morton's---They do get you on the shellfish but that is common!  Def give this place a try but make a reservation way ahead of time because it is a fairly small place and usually books up!",real

There pizzas have great flavor and our cooked to perfection. If you looking for a good pizza as well as many other great menu items this is the place!!Enjoy,real
"First of all, let me start off by saying I'm a really big fan of seafood on breakfast menus.  Any breakfast spot that has seafood on their breakfast menu automatically starts out ahead of their competition.  The CuyahogaBenedict at Jack Flaps is fabulously executed.  It's exactly what I like ina breakfast dish, although there is no egg in it, well no chicken eggs!The Breakfast Kimchi is delightfully spicy, and so is the wait staff.  The guys are bearded and the girls are petite and nearly everyone has piercings and/or tattoos.  I've also had the Shrimp and Grits (hold the bacon) and it's great.  Coffee is very good.  Ambiance is very hip, a little on thesmall side, but that adds a mystique; a fervor. Having to wait in line to get a seat boosts the popularity of the establishment.  The artwork around the place is well done and interesting and sometimes risqué especially on the restrooms, and oh yeah, the restrooms are clean.  Lastly, good news,they are taking over PJ's in the Old Arcade and will be serving breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Chrystal will be heading this up this effort, can't wait... Oh, and before I forget, did I mention they have a gorgeous waitstaff.",real

"My wife and I went to the one in SF before and Hubert Keller has definitely created a whole new experience in Vegas.  The place is very contemporary and elegant. We were seated in one of the private cabanas so we have complete privacy.  The staff was very friendly and relaxed.  The food is absolutely top notch and very innovative.  We were amazed of the ingredients used and how complex the taste of each dish was.  On top of that, we definitely had the propensity to take pictures of each dish because they were all beautifully presented (even the plate itself).  Highly recommend: Onion and black truffle soup, Poached lobster, Banana split, and the Rib-eye steak.",real

"Eddie Merlot's, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways:1) conveniently located in the Sprouts Shopping Center with easy access and a large brightly lit parking lot2) a beautiful and inviting atmosphere that rivals any restaurant in the western world!3) a cheerful, smiling and enthusiastic staff that greet you the moment you walk through the door4) the most comfortable restaurant chairs you'll ever sit in5) live entertainment in the lounge6) personable and excellent service from the entire staff, but we are partial to lovely Taylor - Eddie Merlot's keeps your preferred server's name on file so you always get the same server (if that's your preference)7) the potato chips! I could write a sonnet about the freshly made chips. Trust me, just order them8) the extensive wine list - WOW is all I can say9) the lobster bisque with chunks of lobster - I asked for EXTRA lobster and they are happy to oblige for a small up charge 10) the menu - too long to list but suffice it to say, you'll be very happy with the fine selection of steaks and seafood11) the Management - clearly Eddie Merlot's knows a thing or two about people and they've assembled a professional staff in Scottsdale that ROCKS!12) the Eddie Merlot Club - what an ingenious idea. You pay 25.00 for a one year membership and immediately receive a 20.00 coupon. The minute we arrived home there was an email thanking us for our patronage with yet ANOTHER coupon, this one for 25.00 for our upcoming anniversary. Once you join their Eddie Merlot club, you'll receive all sorts of perks. I highly recommend joining if you love dining here ... AND YOU WILL!",real

"It must have been written in the stars that we (4 foodie, boozy Bostonians) would find this place. The food was amazing, the service impeccable!! It didn't hurt that the entire staff was gorgeous. Silvio, the owner, took SUCH good care of us. We've never experienced such warmth, generosity, and sincere care. Our late lunch experience was so fabulous that we had to repeat it. The food far exceeded our expectations - wowed us, in fact- and the wine selections were lovely. We will be coming back again on our next visit to Montreal. I can only imagine that the hotel services are just as fabulous.",real
The buffets in Las Vegas are usually awful.  Salty overcooked meats and watery vegetables.  In fact some of the meats are mystery meats if you know what I mean.  This one is one of the best .  Great variety and the vegetables are superb.,real

I've lived in the neighborhood for a couple years and never had been here before. I'm so glad I suggested it. The dining room was beautifully decorated for Christmas (a little early) and our server was attentive. Coffee was good and our breakfast was delicious. My husband got the Country Benedict. The gravy was delicious and had plenty of sausage in it. I got the standard two egg breakfast with sausage. The eggs were poached perfectly. The only thing I thought was a little odd was that I only got one slice of toast (with no butter). Other than that we had a great experience and will go back.,real
Absolutely amazing Pho!! The Wings were also amazing. The best meal I had in a while so far is the wonderful service or a bar was fantastic!  Delicious and fresh sushi with excellent service.,fake

"Wow!Saw this place yesterday, but already had dinner plans. I saw they had Eggplant Parmesan on the menu, so I made plans for dinner the following night.Service is fantastic. One seats you, another brings water, another brings bread. Let's start with the bread - your normal sourdough loaf BUT THE BUTTER - 2 little scoops sitting in olive oil and Italian spices. Dang that's good! I usually don't eat the bread (""why risk the carbs?"" - Get Smart) but I ate ALL THE BREAD.Now onto the Shrimp Scampi Venezia. So good. I ordered more bread to soak up the garlic white wine sauce.Eggplant Parmesan. I started with the sauce - always start with just the sauce. More on the salty side rather than the sweet side. Not overly salty, just pointing out the difference. Personally, I prefer Prego brand over Ragu brand (sweet vs salty). The eggplant is thiiiick - the way it should be. I want to know I'm eating a vegetable, not a deep fried vegetable skin. This is spot on. Comes with side of pasta or potato.I will be back. Very enjoyable experience.",real
Some of the best Mexican food in town that I have ever tried around the corner from my work. Great food and great service. Felt like a must try if you are in Vegas!,fake
Amazing. Came here with a date night with my girlfriend. Everyone was so friendly and the service is excellent! She explained the menu and chammed oversized at all times.

Plus going on $2 Taco Tuesday night even topped my first visit here!  I also tried some of the nachos that my friend ordered and it was very yummy, as well as the 3 tacos that I ordered. The chips and salsa were also great! The waitress was very welcoming and the service was above and beyond! At the end of our meal my friends and I were debating getting dessert, and the waitress paid for our dessert since it was our first time there, how awesome! I will definitely be going back!",real
"I absolutely LOVE Firefly.  I come here pretty frequently, only because my friends from out-of-town have fallen in love with the restaurant just as much as I have and always need to get their fix whenever they come into Vegas.  This place can get pretty packed and wait times can be crazy around dinner time, but trust me.. if you've got the time, it's worth it!  I almost always get... - calamari- stuffed dates- mushroom tart- ceviche- mac & cheese- filet mignon sliders- steamed mussels- firefly fries- sparkling sangria The spread that's given with your breads is also heaven, mmmm.",real
Had an amazingly delicious and creamy hot chai tea latte here. I would drink these things all day if they weren't 1000 calories. What does that equal in kcal? Anyway.

It's great to see a local restaurant doing such a great job!You have to stop in and see the newly remodeled bar area and have the bartenders serve you a drink. This place is a MUST go! :)",real
"Why this by far is the best buffet in Vegas; 1) 2 types of steamed to order crab legs, 2) authentic dim sum, 3) made to order noodles-ramen, wonton, pho, 3) freshly sliced charcuterie, 4) selection of hot foods, 5) but most of all the desserts-made to order crepes, hot from the oven soufflés, gelato bar, variety of macaroons, hot chocolate cookie a la mode,etc!  If you're going to wait in line for an hour for a buffet then this is the one worthy of the time.",real
The ambiance was perfect for food that was a great experience! Come here and try it out! Also lamb shank is also delicious. I love their brownie cocktail. The best ever!!!,fake
Really enjoy this place!! no longer wait!!!  The food is always hot and scrumptious! A great thing to stop often!,fake
"There is really not much I can say here that has not already been said. There is a wide variety of extremely delicious desserts and treats here. It is located in the heart of Hendertucky and has a very small town feel to it, which is somewhat refreshing. I had the Napoleon and Cheese Danish... the desserts were very well balanced and not overly sweet. The staff is always very pleasant and the prices extremely reasonable. Come early as they run out of some of the favorite like the cheese danish quickly.",real

"Great place to eat! Like most reviews here, its like a Subway (but better) and your food gets rolled in a pita (white or wheat). Try the Dagwood Pita (Black Forrest Ham, Turkey and Prime Rib) its a-m-a-z-i-n-g. I have tried quite a few different pitas from this place and none of them disappoint.....every pita is great.The restaurant is always clean, staff friendly, and I have yet to wait more than 1-2 minutes to place/pay for my order (they are fast!).If I had one gripe.....and its minor.....the pitas are maybe $1 more than they should be. If they lowered their prices $1 across the board, I bet they would get more business.",real

I had the Kobe meatloaf which was flavorful and light the Parmesan mashed potatoes and green beans were delicious. my husband had prime rib and said it was outstanding. our friends had center cut sirloin and there wasn't a piece left on their plates. highly recommend you try this restaurant.",real

"One of the best places I have found to get authentic Italian pizza in NC since I have left south Florida.  This place is a small Italian joint in Gastonia that has awesome food for even better prices.  They recently raised their prices and are still more competitive then some of the other Italian places around.  My mother lives close to here and we get salads and slices of pizza for lunch.  Great salads!  I mean when I pay $8-$10 for a salad I usually expect a nice sized portion with fresh ingredients.  This place does exactly that! And for less!  The slices are hot and fresh and the pizzas are reasonably priced for the whole family. II would put this up with some of my favorite pizza places in my home town where NY style pizza is perfected (since all of the snow birds decided to retired down there and open up an NY italian place) The staff is friendly and this is my go to pizza place.  I have driven from Mount Holly to ""deep"" Gastonia to order a pie from Enzo's.  Its well worth the drive.",real
Must get the pad Thai and the burger has a nice thing for me.,fake
"I' just finished my burger and fries and it was just as good as the first 10x iv been here.  The fries are thin cut, think Mc Donalds fries. The waygu burger is so freaking good the meat and the bun are excellent. This to me is hands down the best burger in town. I eat burgers and pizza every week so I'm considered a professional. I have also tried the ramen and that is really good too. I tried a ramen that wasnt spicy and i didnt care for it. Theres a lot of noodles and not a lot of vegtables. I had a spicy miso something and it was delicious. I usually go with the burger but if u like ramen try it out. I really like this place but maybe I'm being extra nice because I'm buzzed off a hoppy ipa on draft I got. Good times.",real
"Was on a family trip to Vegas and burgers are my go to thing so I had to try it out! And it didn't disappoint!! The burgers were juicy and tasty,strawberry milkshake was great (could have been a little more blended to make it easier to drink) but never the less still so good! Double bacon cheesy fries were ""MMM""! Even had chicken burger and it was so good! The chicken had a very nice crispiness and very moist but not overly oily! I like how they have cups for water or their house lemonades. Long lines but goes by fast and good service, location was also easy to find and in a good area.There's always a debate between ""5 guys,In N out and Shake shack"". I like 5 guys but hands down I was converted into a Shake Shack women!",real
I'm a die hard mellow mushroom fan. Pizza is killer so is the staff and the atmosphere,real

"I just moved to the area 3 days ago, I have now eaten at Clockwork twice. The first time I had their slice, salad & drink special for $5. Tonight I ordered a large calzone. First let me start by saying, I am from Chicago, so I would consider myself a pizza aficionado. Their pizza was the best I have had in the 4 years I have been in AZ, hands down. It's a thin crust, sliced NY style. The ""side"" salad is a nice size with a generous amount of toppings. Every bite was more than just lettuce. Tonight I had the large deluxe calzone for $10, it's a monsterous size and enough for 3 meals. They slice it into strips so you can eat it without utensils. (Which was nice for me since I have no idea what box my silverware is in!) It was also extremely delicious. Overall, the food is outstanding and the portion sizes are generous, great value for the money. I will be eating there alot!!",real

It was 7 courses of pure culinary bliss.  The chef here is a master in his craft.  The highlights were the charcuterie plate, a whole fish followed by a venison roast that was out of this world.  The deserts are wonderful as well.  A must while in Toronto.",real

This location opened recently. The staff are friendly and outgoing here. I ordered a bowl with steak and I feel like they are more generous with the toppings than other locations. The taste is pretty consistent with other locations except the mild salsa tasted less citrusy than other places... it could be that it was made fresh and the flavours didn't have enough time to absorb. The employee that helped me was really funny and we engaged in small talk. I was enjoying myself so much that I forgot to grab a fork before I left the store. I enjoy this location much more than the other one nearby. I'll definitely come back to this location.,real
"There's not much I can add to all of the stellar reviews posted.  This is a locals and tourist hot spot.

You see people coming here more frequently that they do for their own jobs and there's A reason - it's just that good.The owners are generous allowing you to sample as many as you want and you'll most likely order 2-3 flavors wishing you could order at least another 2-3 more.",real
Oh my goodness is one of the best wings I've had. The taste is very tasty and flavorful. You can't beat the quality and flavor and they have coperal size for dessert!,fake
"I haven't heard of this chain, but I was looking for a quick bite tonight and wow was I impressed! I got the veggie cheesesteak with the works. As a vegetarian, it was so good I had to second guess if it was in fact vegetarian (it was). Well done vegetarian food for a chain!",real
"Everything was incredible. I went with a group of three and we shared everything family-style,  which I suggest when you're here, and not a single thing we ordered was less than amazing. Duck fat fries, do it! As a side note, I'm not much of a meat eater, a recovering vegetarian really, but I can gladly make exceptions for the kind of experiences Pig in a Fur Coat serves up.The place is small, somewhat cozy, and really enjoyable - both laid back and a bit classy. Good for small groups - visiting with family or friends but not big work parties.",real
We ordered a bunch of pizza and a couple of small plates they were short staffed and will sooo take advantage of while visiting Vegas!,fake
Came here with friends and we loved it. I had the beef tasted like heaven. Excellent potatoes and tacos from here.  My favorite is the blackberry crepe.,fake
"This place was awesome! Wanted a quick brunch and were so happy to find this place. Tons of options on the breakfast side, with omelets, pancakes, and yogurts. I got the eggs with potatoes and toast which were so good. The whole wheat toast was surprisingly delicious and the potatoes were seasoned perfectly. My boyfriend got the dark chocolate pancakes which were equally amazing. The service was a little slow but I think the waitress was new. There were definitely some more interesting ""healthier options"" but still traditional breakfast options as well. Wish I lived closer so I could go back ASAP!",real
Ok well i stopped by for a to go order and this chick that took my order was awesome not only did she ask my questions she also hooked me up with extra blue cheese so im so used to getting my order screwed up at other places she had it correct and when i said thank you and tipped her she was like thanks alot i really appreciate it....  She had an awesome personality sorry i didnt get her name only downside to this thurs was they took 20 mins but the carryout girl at noon was great!,real
"A Chipotle version for pizzas. I ordered 10 pies for my family and every single one of us loved them.It's really hard to say and remember what we ordered because it's so custom, but I loved my Buffallo chicken pizza. The pizzas came out quickly for a large order. The staff was courteous and patient with me, while placing a large order. I wish they had one of these back home.",real
Our new favorite place.  We went for dinner with two Garlic Shrimp and the food delicious!,fake
A diamond in the rough! Cleveland is not really a city known for it's culinary treasures but amongst the few handful of places in the Cleveland area this place certainly stands out. The food and the service were exceptional! The fried bananas were out of this world delicious! Highly recommend and will definitely dine here again when back in Cleveland. :),real
"Read review on lots of different Vegas buffets and saw that all of them had bad reviews mixed with good.  Was almost swayed away from here because of a few reviews, but glad I followed my gut (pun intended).  Went for dinner at about 8:00. Crab legs were my draw, and I wasn't disappointed at all. They had 3 types (cold, split cold, and warm).  All were good. Not a ton of meat in each, but you can eat as many of those suckers as you want, so I was VERY pleased.  Pizza was good, surprisingly.  I also had the sushi, and that was good. The buffet is very spread out and you can get full before you even get to the other end.Now here are some tips that I wish I would have read before I went that I will share with you:1) Buy your ""tickets"" at one of those 1/2 price ticket places along the strip.  It costs $2 per person for each voucher which will discount your meal drastically. We paid ONLY $49ish for TWO of us for dinner. That's less than $25 per person, or 1 bet on blackjack.  GREAT deal!2) If you are staying anywhere near Harrah's, you can take the free shuttle to Rio. It boards every half hour from the valet section (back of building) of Harrah's. It picks you up and returns you too.3) They have 2 buffets on 1 place. One is seafood and one is not.  The seafood one costs more.  If you just want crab legs DO NOT pay for the seafood upgrade because the non-seafood side had crab legs too!  Nice bonus. The non-seafood side also had sushi, trout, crawfish, and such. Not sure how much more the other side had.Finally, I want to give a shoutout to Orlando. He was awesome.  The drinks (soft drinks were included) kept coming, and he was clearing plates swiftly and with a smile.Thanks, Orlando, and Rio for a great surprise!",real
Great service and food! Kids loved the pizza and wings. The service was excellent as well as the food. We will definitely be back.,fake
we love polishe and very clean nice atmosphere.  A must try for all-variant staff and best and the prices are good for all the fancy appetizers where all delicious (and I am very happy with the service that was 3 minutes prior to the place.  Will definitely come back again.,fake
"Surprised at myself for becoming such a regular here and have yet to write a review, but I love love love love LOVE Grouchy John's. All time favorite coffee shop in Las.... anywhere! Everything here is all about the locals and I love it. I never fail to come here before work, after work, sometimes gotta drink a coffee before bed. The interior feels so homey and is super colorful, but most of the time I do go through the drive-thru (which is open 24/7), and later in the night a barista, Randi, always helps me out and is super sweet! She never messes up my order and is super quick and we always have a nice little convo. If you come to vegas, or if you live here, TRY THIS PLACE OUT!",real
"I love this place! I always get takeout from this place almost every Friday for their staff and boyfriends have to eat here. The food is just as good. Food comes out very quickly and the service is always great. I live nearby and it's far from the strip. The staff are friendly and efficient, and the food is great. Go here for sushi in San Diego and find the same I don't live on this side of town I found it on accident. The portions were huge, the service was excellent and their delicious pork tacos and pad Thai. Service is always top notch and the drinks are always good.  Service is great and we always get the night downtown and have never been disappointed. I love it so much they get us adorable out the door.",fake
"Karben4 makes some of my favorite beer, not just here, but anywhere.  Fantasy Factory IPA is on my short list of favorites, along with Nightcall Smoked Porter, but, really, everything I've had is superb and worth a try.  If you're lucky enough to be there when one of their limited release brews is pouring, do yourself a favor and have a taste.  There's not one all the time, but they have a nice seasonal rotation and some one offs.  Memorable entrants includes Oaktoberfest, Clown Nose Scotch Ale, and Idiot Farm Imperial IPA.  And you have to try their coffee stout when it returns - a collaboration with the folks across the street at Just Coffee (who happen to be my favorite roaster too, a match made in heaven!).  There's often something on nitro tap, which gives you a new look at a beer.  Karben4's menu is kind of a modern twist on bar food, made with lots of local providers like Underground Meats, Stalzy's breads, and their beers make appearances in several food items.  This is another of Madison's local places where the staff shows their pride in what they're doing.  They're happy to pour you a taste if you're having trouble deciding what to order.  I was sitting at the bar with a Lady Luck (their Irish Red) from the nitro tap, next to someone drinking the same beer from the regular tap, and the bartender gave us each a sample of the opposite beer to compare.  I'm always a bit surprised how many ""beer people"" know of K4 but haven't been there yet.  Then you tell them it's in ""the old Ale Asylum,"" and they nod in understanding.  They've really transformed the place and made it their own, though, it's a much brighter, more open-feeling space (not that there was anything wrong with the Asylum, they have their own very cool style, as does Karben 4).  If parking is full, keep going down the lot, there's more space at the end.  Superb beers, delicious food, and great atmosphere.  Definitely one of my favorite places!",real
I have never had a bad meal here great food. Everything I have tried is good. The hummus is cooked to perfection. Highly recommended!!,fake
"5 stars. Service, food, atmosphere, friendly staff and very knowledgeable waiter. There was no waiting (for table or for food) even on a Friday night. Food was phenomenal. Love pastrami pork belly, their specialty salad and my main dish (spare rib).",real

1st time coming here and hands down the best food and service I've ever had!! Super super attentive service. The best burger you can get in town.This is probably the best we've ever had and they always seem to make a reservation.,fake
Best kept secret in Vegas!!!  I've done their tasting menu's twice now.  The absolute best!!!,real
A bit of a drive from the strip. Sit at the bar just to eat. The only downside is that it's hard to find prime rib but in downtown Toronto. Service and food is fantastic. Chocolatine are to die for! :),fake
"Stopped in for the first time and the staff was consistently delicious and fast.  I highly recommend this dish.  Also, my friend had the French toast with the garlic aioli and the chicken plate that is so yummy and the classic hibachi is amazing! The staff is super friendly and the food is always good.",fake
"Discovered this restaurant on a Wednesday evening not expecting too much of a crowd but came to find it packed before, during, and after our dinner. There was a slight wait but they keep things moving quickly! The pork belly steamed buns were to die for, an absolute foodgasm. The short ribs are a must, absolutely amazing as well. The sauce had a kick to it but with molasses like sweetness. Great wine as well, don't be afraid to order by the glass, the menu only shows prices by the bottle. Definitely a must stop in Montreal!",real
Had dinner tonight with my wife and the service and food was outstanding. The Dynomite roll was delicious as well as the Dragon Roll. The fried cheesecake was a great way to cap off our dinner.  Our server Savannah was outstanding!! Looking forward to date night next week.,real

"This place has the best ramen I've ever had outside Japan! It's run by two older Japanese men who wear the traditional Japanese chef head covers and talk to each other in Japanese.  The menu is quite simple: four kinds of ramen, a few other dishes, and some appetizers/sides. The service is quick, the prices are very reasonable, and the food is delicious!  I recently spent five days in Las Vegas and ended up eating dinner there twice because it was so good.",real

"I can see below who the fake reviewer is. I'll let you guess, but come on, I hate that. There's no need to supply a fake review, this is a Las Vegas favorite with a couple of locations. The only reason I know about this place is because I used to be a local, and I knew it when it was plastic lawn chairs and flourescent lighting. My old las vegas chess buddy turned mathematician turned magician took me here and it was overwhelming. it is now a chic dimly lit casbah of lush, with nice curtains, a hookah bar in the back, gold handcarved heavy frames over original paintings, lush, luxiourious, and....cheap?it's basically the same dirt cheap prices, $12 for an entree, etc. and the waitstaff are friendly and local. I showed them some magic and the entire staff gathered around our table. One of the staff members ran away into the kitchen, he really believes in voodoo, we laughed behind his back. we even went out with the waitress to see a chamber music show at UNLV, that's how friendly friendly gets. Try their bruschetta salad--yum, and I've always liked their Mediterranean standards babaganoosh, etc.Really good fries too.",real
"Great budget Chinese food. Loved the chow mein, Mongolian beef, and Singapore noodles. Friendly staff. Large portions. Lunch specials were huge.",real

"We were introduced to this place about 3 months ago and we are now regulars. The Hub is in the top 3 of our favorite restaurants in the Valley. Top notch service, amazingly consistent and delicious food, great atmosphere, and it's only 2mi from our house. I'd recommend a menu item to try, but honestly they are all great. The smoked wings are THE best wings I have ever had. I can eat them by the pound (Wednesday is the wing special btw). If you haven't been here, you are missing out on great food and a rare dining experience that many ""fancy"" restaurants can't even come close to matching. Ask for Audree, she is our favorite server. Chances are Chris, the manager, will come by and chat as well. Say hello and enjoy!Oh yeah, kids get to go to the 'Treausre Chest' after the meal to pick out a toy. Usually Hot Wheels, Barbie, princess stuff, etc; Definitely kid friendly!",real
Best ramen place in town. The bread is the best. The tuna sushi is also really good. Atmosphere is friendly and attentive. Be prepared to get my order right and he loves it. I don't really taste the difference. We'll be back.,fake
"Came here for brunch with a pretty large group of people. We were seated with no problem and drinks were given to us immediately. Our server was really nice and attentive to our needs so our cups didn't go empty for very long. He was also pretty great at giving us advice on what food to get.I ended up ordering the Southwestern omelette with hash browns. First off, I love potatoes-- any kind, and these were just great. For 10.99 you really got your moneys worth, the omelette and servings in general were pretty generous.My omelette has chorizo, tomato, peppers, cheese and I added mushrooms. I felt that the way my omelette was cooked was to perfection. I really appreciated that and the fact that the cheese was cooked to the point where it was stringy when cutting into my omelette. Also, we ordered drinks at the restaurant which were SO good. Overall, the place is a great place for breakfast/brunch/lunch. Staff is so nice and the food is great and very reasonably priced. I'm really grateful that I was introduced to this place because I am definitely planning on coming again.",real
"I took our 15 year old Grand Daughter to see ""Max"" today. We loved this theater experience. Got the premium tickets. The popcorn was delicious with the added butter. Our meal of pizza, lobster roll and sweet potato fries was so good! And as other reviews have noted, the fries stayed crispy throughout. Our seat were plush and comfortable and the pillows and blankets were a nice touch. I will definitely be back with my husband next time!",real
"I am a regular at Bunglow for SO many reasons! The coffee is always good and the baked goods are amazing...dangerously so. There's nothing like homemade magic bars and/or lemon bars (yes, there are days that both happen...) and a good cup of coffee. Mike and Betty are wonderful, friendly and manage to always make my day/week better. My favorite coffee shop for sure!",real
"This place is amazing. I love bento boxes, steak, and sushi. This place offers me all of the above for a great price. The steak bento ($9.50) is huge and perfectly cooked. The miso soup was average as was the rice and salad but the tempura was perfectly crispy but not overly breaded or soggy. The California roll was great and the steak omg. So i ordered it rare amd figured theyd overcook it but it was perfect. The super white tuna is great and its my favorite. The mango Philly roll was nicely prepared and delicious. The service is good and I plan to be back.",real
When I don't come here this place was the friendliest people that we call table side of the drive thru which was a great place to go.,fake
Delicious!!!  I ate pretty much the entire menu with my friends there.  Spaetzle was awesome!!!  Wienerschnitzel with the fried egg on top....amazing...Service was excellent and the food and drink were great.  It was hilarious watching these old high school group of friends (probably in their 40s or so and were probably Pittsburgh lifers) doing shotskis and drinking up a storm and then we got to see boobs as one of them flashed the entire room.  It was hilarious and so cute because you could tell they had been friends for god knows how long and  truly loved Pittsburgh.  It's nice to see that kind of unquestionable dedication.  And old boobs.  LMAO!,real

Amazing food and very good service.  I ordered the donut burger with a bottle of wine and basically gave excellent cooking in the cafe. Been coming here since I was about 6 months ago. I have been here many times and it is always a breath of fresh and menu as well. Their food is always superb. The staff is friendly and helpful.  The food and service are pretty good.  I highly recommend this place over any of the services as well.,fake

My wife and son were also very pleased with their picks.Staff was super friendly and made us feel very welcome. We will be back for sure! Note: Don't bother paying the extra $1 for the flavored fries. We all ordered the parmesan garlic... Not worth it. However, this did not impact my rating!",real
"Initial thoughts upon sitting down with a beer and hitting my first 15 shots: holy cow, I want to build one of these for myself! Getting to the nitty gritty of the review and thinking of the questions people would ask before visiting my review becomes a bit more specific. #1 * The wait staff was hired yesterday. Or at least that is the view I had when asking a few very simple questions about the system used here. They seemed to have zero training on the system used and how to operate simple functions. #2 * Our waitress was very eager to learn from us what we found out through trying it out. #3 * Computer systems down. There were more error screens than you could imagine here. One of the staff even said the app has never worked here. That's pathetic. Get someone on it. My review is sounding awfully negative (but it needed to be said, otherwise no one would know what can be improved upon), which doesn't at all reflect my experience here so the rest will be how much fun I had. * Our waitress Michelle was amazing. It looks like she only had two tables, so you can't beat a ratio of 1:9. She was constantly making sure we were happy with what was on our table. * The music varies a ton! A good thing! I enjoyed listening to the cult classics and party music. * OMG The food! The food was top quality. Worth twice what it costs. No joke. It is blatantly obvious I'm a bullet/list reviewer so here are my key points. *Technology- 6/10 train staff and hire an IT person. * Staff- 10/10 Some of the most friendly and eager staff I've seen around. Keep it up. * Food- 10/10 Id come here just to eat. Period. * Overall experience- 9/10 This place was a blast. I plan on visiting as often as I can when in the area. It is totally worth every penny.",real
The best thing on the menu is the pork shank and Chicken shawarma. The fingerling potatoes are very good as well. The real deal is by far the best if not the same!,fake

"Hi everyone...I'm Rose and I'm a kabacurryholic.  I decided to bump it up another star because I can't get enough of the curry here.  I am seriously addicted.  Although it is a food court that caters to college kids, the curry has me coming back again and again.  I take my orders to go.  And I have to do everything in my power not to tear open the bowl of curry goodness while I am driving.  In my previous review, I was disappointed that I did not have a say in the spice level.  Well, I was wrong- all I had to do was just ask.  Ask and you shall receive. Be on the lookout for the yellow signage in front of the building, guiding you to the land of perfect potato croquettes and delicious curry. I may just have to stop in later today...before the withdrawal tremors kick in.",real
"Just tried the Vig Uptown for the first time.  We had a great time and are definitely going to keep this on our short list of restaurants to visit.  In more detail...Amazing building!  The bocci ball court is definitely a hit with everyone and we were very impressed with the light and airy decor.  Knowing that this used to be a bank, you'd never expect that it would be so beautiful inside.Food - the chicken kebobs were perfect.  I think the best flavors I've ever had in a kebob meal.  The Pad Thai is something that I was looking to try as well and it appears that the recipe is being fine-tuned to be just as good as the dish I had or better.I know that parking is an issue for The Vig right now, but the valets are working their tails off to make it as transparent for the customer as possible.",real

They are so good that I have not tried anything else on the menu since the Wednesday following my first visit.  The serving is huge and packed with flavor!!!  The crust is delicious and holds up perfectly (never soggy or wet, even when reheated after being refridgerated overnight).  In my book, they are fully deserving of a permanent spot on the menu rather than just on Wednesdays.",real

I've been coming to Freed's since I was a little girl and it was originally located on Eastern & Trop and I'm so glad it's in my neighborhood again. It can get quite spendy if you get carried away but oh so worth it. Right now my favorite are the coconut macaroons. Take it from me.

"I went there for the first time today during happy hour, which is everyday 3-6:30. They have so many rolls on the happy hour menu; not like most places that only have a few. And the prices are really reasonable. My boyfriend and I got a bunch of great rolls off of the hh menu but my favorite one was the Cowboy Roll. It was perfectly spicy and had an amazing taste. Another great thing about their sushi here is that they roll the rice how it is supposed to be. So many places that I've been to around Scottsdale always pack in the rice tight which makes the sushi feel tough when you bite into it, but this sushi chef makes it light and fluffy. Perfect! Our waitress, Hunter I believe her name was, was so friendly and informative. She was really welcoming and made me enjoy my experience even more. Sushi Brokers is definitely my new go-to sushi!",real
The food and the service is excellent! I had the Prime Kalbi and Meatball special which were to die for. I will definitely be back.,fake
I had a fabulous waitress every time I got my food truck.  We will be back again!,fake
"This place has delicious and well priced food. Everything I've ordered tastes so so so so good!I personally like the homey feel to the restaurant. Super casual and no frills, but not divey either. It gives me a very warm feeling.I highly recommend the French dip and the cheese curds, which are competitive with some of Madison's top rated restaurants.",real
Amazing food and service! Staff was friendly and made us feel welcome! I got a seat with pickup cart with the whole time.,fake
Excellent service! Pho is excellent. It's right across from the street. Worth every penny :),fake
PET-FRIENDLY!I loved this place already because they allow pets on leashes on the outdoor patio.  All of Montelago Village is very pet friendly - it is a fun place to walk your dog and enjoy the Lake Las Vegas views.  The food at Auld Dubliner happens to be pretty darn good as well.  The Irish Quesadilla had very good fresh salsa on the side.  The seared tuna salad had a lot of flavor and the fish was very fresh.  Nice selections of imported beers on draft too.Don't forget the $5 Irish Car Bombs during Happy Hour!,real
Great place with a lot of wait staff. The menu is diver amazing and the service was outstanding.  Maria has a great option for a relaxing and relaxed dining spot in Pittsburgh. Go try out this place if you like chicken teriyaki sauce.,fake

I have been to this place many times and kids love the chicken tenders. Friendly staff and quick service. A little heavy on the other thing on the menu it's better than other restaurants I've been to period. Never had a bad anything with the fresh chips and salsa.,fake
"We love niccos! We use to go to Pizza Hut all the time because we tried so many pizza places and they were terrible, then we found niccos! Great meat lovers and cheese bread is amazing!

"Great food great staff! I was worried about the food, but the best everything had a great feel with a great atmosphere. It's too bad one of is my favorite restaurant in North Phoenix. Friendly service, excellent food. Definitely a place to visit when I'm on the nootel had one of the best subs in town. Awesome atmosphere, service, ambiance and overall food. My wife and I loved it.",fake
"I really don't know why it took me so long to finally come to The Old Fashioned. I owe my friends an apology for not coming sooner!I had the No.30 with cheese curds and an old fashioned. I still love Curd Girl's cheese curds more, but these are a very close second. The burger though, wow. They definitely know how to do an egg burger well. It's on par with the Mountie Burger at the Dane, if not better. I'm thrilled to have found it since the Dane just changed their menu and got rid of the Mountie. The Old Fashioned is definitely going to become my new late night burger place. I could go on a rant about the sweet brandy old fashioned I had, but I'm sure there's a long list of other reviewers who have done the same. Save us both the time and just order it! You won't regret it.",real
"This place is great, great drinks, super atmosphere, open early for coffee, open late for drinks and music. I've seen so many good shows here in this tiny little venue I'm so appreciated that it's in my neighbourhood.I can't think of another venue in general where you can see experimental electronic music, folk, country, rock, hip hop,poetry readings etc etc... Great place",real
"I finally made it in after seeing the incredible Yelp reviews... and wow, they did not disappoint! The depth and breadth of the menu is fantastic! You honestly cannot go wrong.Hopefully the amazing Kay is working the bar, and you have made the proper choice of ponying up to the bar.... she is remarkable. She will even answer questions you didn't even know you had!Enjoy! #yum",real

"Wow! I don't know why it took so long for us to check out the place but man oh man, it was great. We got the green curry and red curry, the pad Thai, the crab puffs. Everything is so delicious. It's the beat Thai food that I have had",real
"Stopped by last weekend for a drink and some food and was shocked that I have not heard more about this place! I loved it! I don't know if I should start by mentioning the great margaritas or the amazing ambiance! First off when my friends and I first arrived we were greeted and sat in a very timely manner! The decor of the resturant was amazing! It reminded me of Javier's but with less ropes everywhere! Ha and more of a nice trendy Mexican restaurant that you would go to for a nice occasion! After we got seated our server, I think Mack it was? Came over to get our orders! He was great!!!! Very spunky and lots of energy which was great because we wanted to get on his level, so we ordered a few rounds of drinks. Then we placed an order of the nachos in because Mack sold us on the happy hour menu! They arrived so fast, we were shocked! They tasted amazing and then...we ordered another round of drinks. After we were about to wrap up, The server brought us our check and me mentioned that on Monday's they have a special for $25 all you can eat street tacos and margaritas! So needless to say we will be back because that is an amazing deal!Can't wait to try more items on the menu!!!",real
Had an absolutely amazing server and she was fantastic!  Food was very good.  I usually go with a corn soup (looks amazing) well done.,fake
Great pizza and good prices. We usually order out but the restaurant atmosphere looks fun even if we decide to dine in. Love the fresh toppings.,real
"The fish was very fresh and delicious. The service was blowing with many varieties to choose from. The Shit Martini was amazing & our food served was all very fresh and delicious. Hardest broth is the mango stuffed pizzas and baklava. They also have a drive thre of old towners. So, do yourself a favor......And the burgers are top notch!",fake
"This place is really great.  Have been there 5 times and tried almost everything on the menu.  All appetizers are excellent - pork buns, pig wings (little pork ribs,) and thai fried chicken!  My only gripe is many dishes are a bit too spicy for my taste.  But there is something for everyone and the atmosphere is wonderful.",real
Wow! I have passed this place daily for two years and finally tried it. So fresh and delusions!,real
"We were running a relay race that had us in this part of town while waiting for one of our runners. Found this place on a Yelp, it's awesome! We enjoyed it so much we went back the next day. Both times Tom was our waiter, he's very friendly and enjoyable. The hash browns are the best I've had. If you are going to spend calories on eating hash browns, theses are the ones to eat! Golden and perfectly crispy. Tasty pancakes too that are perfect texture.",real
Chicken tikka masala was delectable. Pineapple pudding with bacon is the way to go.,fake
"I finally found a great Italian Restaurant in the middle of downtown.  Nothing fancy, and the food are good.  I had such a nice simple chicken curry so I don't speak for all the things I've tried. The sandwiches are always great too. Great service and a comfortable place to hang out with friends and enjoy their special occasions.",fake
"Biscuits and gravy, and green curry with shrimp & grits are to die for & the french fries are soooo good. I can't wait to go back.",fake

"Love this place! Cool little hipster spot! Great pizza, great service! Me and my gf love this place.",real
Had breakfast here with friends. Great food and service. the best everything!,fake
"Food is wholesome and very good. Little tight on space, but worth squeezing into. No GF bread options (although it is categorized as a GF restaurant). There are GF deserts which was a plus!",real
"Ok, OK, there is one of these practially on every block... So what is so special about this one. Since my kids love sandwiches, we have been to many of these and this one is great because:Service - The manager and staff are pleasant, well trained, friendly and treat you like family.Food - Come on, it is basically the same. I cannot compare.  But I will recommend that you use the Italian Herb and Cheese bread, have your sandwich toasted, and put all you want on it, but then use the spices, the sweet onion dressing, and oregano and you will be set!Price - Like all the subways, reasonable.What really makes this place is that the service is just phenomenal.Check it out!",real
"Excellent dinner for breakfast. Ground beef juicy shrimp taco and crispy duck, mashed potatoes. It was all delicious.  When we come back in home to Persian for a happy night dinner and drinks and food to go and talking to my normal family friendly.",fake

"We recently had an amazing catering experience for our 75 person party with Mykonos Grill. This was the first time we hosted such a large event and Peter clearly showed that his primary concern was the success of our party. He was extremely helpful, offering lots of tips on how to best serve and arrange the food with so many people, and never made us feel rushed anytime we stopped by or called with a question. The food was delivered on time and was a huge hit with our guests, everything was delicious! We've dined in the restaurant before as well and both the service and food were excellent. We couldn't recommend this restaurant enough.",real

The service is great and the employees are always fun, friendly and pleasant to talk to. Everything about Picazzo's makes for a great dining experience.",real
"When pressed for their favorite AYCE sushi place, most Vegas locals can name at least one. Oyshi on Rainbow is mine. I've been here for lunch and dinner, by myself and on dates. Most often, my roommates and I just roll up after one of us so much as mentions sushi.The food is delicious and extremely fresh. I'm from New York where all-you-can-eat sushi is unheard of--and would be pretty suss if you did hear of it. Less than $30 for seafood? What, was it fished out of Hudson River?Sashimi platters are the only thing on the menu that isn't AYCE. Dessert, however, is. I highly recommend their chocolate creme brûlée! For apps, you must try their Ahi Poke.I'm partial to their Shrimp Tempura hand rolls, which I can, and have, eaten 3-4 of in one sitting. Other favorites include: Kami-Kaze, Oh My Heart, and Lobster Fair. If you like nigiri, you should check the chalkboard when you come in for the daily specials. Pro Tip: If you sit at the bar, you can order half-rolls! It's a great way to try more rolls if you're like me and have limited tummy space, but eyes bigger than your stomach.",real
Great service. I had the Honey Western Burger and it was delicious. I got the meatloaf sandwich with veggies for dinner and added Peter and it was amazing. The server was awesome and informative about the menu with service to the food no charge better and the staff was attentive. Great wait staff.  Yummm!,fake
"I feel fully qualified to give this review as I eat here at least once a week!  The chef is amazing and her menu is a fresh take on modern comfort food.  With different daily specials, you will always be offered something new.  Her chili is the best and make sure to order the special one that is served with a pile of cheesy jalepeno grits on top.  You will never go wrong with any of the daily soups or egg rolls.  If you are in to wings, hers are nice and crisp with the perfect amount of heat.  I really can't say enough about this place...the staff and food are awesome and I am so happy they are in my 'hood!",real
"Fabulous food- different options and presentations  makes ""foodie"" food accessible. Service great and the byob makes it easier to concentrate on the food. Only drawback to the small size of the space is the noise factor at times- Food always of the freshest ingredients and most  interesting combinations. Every time it's been a hit- one of our favorites",real
The pizza was so so amazing. The waiter was very nice and help you when they want an excellent meal or coffee. Small place but fun atmosphere.,fake
Expect to wait a little.   It is worth every minute.  It gives you a chance to absorb all the aromas.  Be adventurous and create your own burger.  Try something new like Elk or Bison.  Don't forget the Bankok Steak Fries.  Enjoy!,real
so good. You can tell they are understaffed by the exterior.,fake

"Fantastic lunch spot!  The fried green tomatoes were piping hot, the deviled eggs were spot on & the lime flank steak served over a corn cake was dynamite!  That being said, I wish I had ordered the shrimp n grits.  I had a taste & I need to come back again to get the full experience!",real
"They have a diverse menu and a really cool atmosphere. My husband and I both had the Chimichurri Steak Frites.  It was so good and very big portions.  It was 2 full size pieces of Argentinean style skirt steak, topped with a herb chimichurri sauce and garlic fries.  Honestly, it's enough for two people to share.  I also had the pomegranite/lime iced tea which was yummy.  They have flat screen TV's all around. You can access the restaurant from the strip or inside New York New York Hotel/Casino.  The prices were average for Las Vegas but the food was well worth the price.",real
"I'm a big fan of the bar-b-q here.  You can smell the smoker working its magic as soon as you enter the restaurant. The star of the show is the meats!  The smoked ham is good too!  They do ribs well, brisket well, and pulled pork well!  I usually get the smoked turkey breast with the montgomery county white sauce.  The turkey is always moist, juicy, and delicious.  The sauce is creamy, slightly vinegary, a little spicy, and peppery.  Love it!   While your waiting for your order, they serve up some of the most incredible cheddar muffins.  Fresh from the oven, and the cheese is gooey in the middle.  Don't eat too many though!  Also, be sure to save room for dessert, the pies here are awesome!  Chocolate pie, peanut butter pie!!  They're really flexible when ordering sides.  I just wish the portion were slightly larger especially for the potato salad.  And they rotate side items daily.  How about fried okra? Bottom Line - they do bar-b-q very well here!  They mix a lot of regional specialties from Carolina pulled pork, to Texas brisket, to Memphis style ribs, to Kansas City style meats here.  They also mix up some good bar-b-q sauces.One of my favs!",real
"Very pleasant, service was great, food was good, prices reasonable. I will go there again when I go to Phoenix. Enjoyed the chips, the tacos and the enchiladas.",real
"Delicious burritos et cetera made with fresh ingredients delivered with a high meat-and-veggies to rice ratio. Plus, for fifty extra cents your burrito can be grilled on the grill, a much tastier thing than I imagined in would be!While Chipoltle may be named after a single chile pepper, this place is named after all of them.Iced tea review: 5/5 stars. Real iced tea, with a hint of lime. The fellow behind the counter even came to my table and offered me a refill. I couldn't ask for a better iced tea experience - especially given the scarcity of iced tea at non-national-chain Mexican restaurants. (They still have the usual complement of bottled Jaritos.)",real
Awesome BBQ joint. This is now my place for good food and a reasonable price. Brunch was great too! Staff was super friendly. Ask for Pans slots.,fake
Best Italian food in town. It's a must try!! Order the Thai dish it's always on point!,fake
"I LOVE cornish pasty!! The ambience is really neat but the place itself is a little small. Everytime I go, I try a new pasty and every one I have tried, I have liked. Good selection of beers (import and domestic). I personally like sitting up at the bar because staff is really friendly and chatty (if you want them to be).If you're looking for a new place to try that's casual, this place is great!",real
"In all the turn around trips we've had to Phx, We've passed this place and it was always closed...but this time it was open and by golly, I was determined to get inside and eat! haha.Upon entering, the atmosphere seemed trendy.  It was artistic, musical, and modern mixed into one awesomely multi-functional space.  I loved the music they played - electro-swing, neo -soul, conscience/revolutionary hip-hop, and jazzy pop. The service was great.  Our server (OH NO I FORGOT HER NAME!!) was very fun loving and friendly.  For us new comers she gave us some awesome brunch suggestions.  Of all days... I wasn't very hungry (UGH!) so i grabbed a soup and salad.  I don't like anything pumpkin - not even pumpkin pie so I was a bit skeptical when our server suggested pumpkin soup.  I'm so glad she did because it was OHmazing!  It had a very light pumpkin taste to it, but it was more like a butternut squash.  I loved the pom seeds.  It gave bursts of tartness to round out the flavor of the soup in your mouth.   The salad was light yet flavorful.  The apples gave it a refreshing taste.  I had a pineapple sparkling lemonade and that was not okay. lol   It was too tart for me.  Yikes!  Aside from the drink, I have to give this place a 5.  It went above and beyond my expectations.  I loved the atmosphere, my food was on point.  Service was great.... I rarely hit a spot twice (there are so many other places I've gotta check out!), but I will definitely be back to try dinner (if it isn't closed when I'm there!)",real

"The service and the food were both excellent. I made a reservation for my wife and I for our fifth wedding anniversary. I added a note on the reservation letting them know of the occasion, and simply asking for a table by the window, if possible. They printed out menus for us that read ""Happy Anniversary"" and our names at the top. That was a very nice touch that I did not expect. We had the Antipasti Platter and the Lobster Risotto as appetizers, the NY Strip and Crab Cakes as entrees, and the Neopolitan Mascarpone Cheescake as dessert. All of the food was excellent, with empahsis on the risotto and cheesecake.",real
"Went to a day during lunch time, and the service was awesome thank you everyone I was telling you that he went there on a Friday night. The place is very clean, staff is always friendly and helpful. I highly recommend that you have to go back to the food truck soon. I love their burritos, and the wife telling ur drink they are super nice and friendly for a more expensive meal that tasted like i'm happy with my strawberry shortcake definitely come to Toronto.  Def a restaurant permitting many times.",fake
"It was my husband and I anversity and we didn't know know where to have dinner. I found Geshia House on Yelp and decided to go there. We were staying on the strip and took a cab, at first I was wondering where was this driver taking us. When we arrived the parking lot was empty  (maybe it was because it was a Sunday night ) it made me worry the place might be close. We went inside and no one was eating there. I asked the host/Server were they open. He said yes and sat us down at a very beautiful table. To be honest I think they were about to close but instead we were given the absolutely  most amazing service ever. We had the whole resuraunat to ourselves. We both order the special, lobster, steak,chicken, and shrimp. First thing we were served was this beef both soup that blew my mind the flavor unlike any other. Chef Edward was charming, entertaining, and incredible talented. He made our night. Everything he cooked was mouth watering delicious. Pure perfection!!!Half way threw our meal the server/host call the cab to  make sure our cab was there by the time dinner was done. True hospitality !! What a wonderful place I am so glad we went there hands down the best dinner experience of my life. Thank you Geshia House for making our anniversary the best yet!!",real

"It was a gamble between deciding which Thai place to eat at and I'm glad I picked this place! After reading all the reviews I knew it was a matter of time until I tried it out. We ordered the pad see ew with tofu & vegetables and panang curry with chicken, both spice level 3/10. The pad see eww is one of the best I've tasted before. It had lots of flavor, vegetables weren't too soft or over cooked, and the noodles were thin so you could possibly eat all of it in one sitting! The vegetables inside was asparagus, which I thought is an interesting choice. But it's cut up so small you wouldn't be able to tell what it is until you eat it. We also got the panang curry with chicken, also very tasty! It came with a side of rice, but tasted even better on the noodles. Both of these dishes were 3/10 spicy which I didn't think was spicy at all.Service was awesome, servers were very attentive and always refilling our waters every time we took a drink! I will definitely be back to try other dishes on the menu, maybe even kick up the spice levels too!",real
"I've been to the Egg & I several times, and each time breakfast has been great.  Went once with my wife and I and sat outside and enjoyed one of their excellent scrambles and a delicious benedict, both of which we really enjoyed.  The second visit was this past weekend with my parents and brother and sister in law.  Food and service were both fantastic.  I had the chicken and chorizo breakfast burrito, while others enjoyed the cordon bleu skillet, a chorizo skillet, a french dip sandwich with cajun fries and an eggs benedict.  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food, which was brought very quickly given how packed the place was - talk about an efficient kitchen.  Our cups (water and coffee) never ran dry and the waiter struck the perfect balance between leaving us be to enjoy our meals and making sure we got what we need.  Will definitely be back in the future to this outstanding place.  Love it!",real

"Magnifique expérience! Nous sommes allés à la Maison Boulud pour célébrer une occasion spéciale, et nous n'avons pas été déçu!. L'ambiance était chaleureuse, et le personnel accueillant. Nous étions assis dans les jardins du Ritz. La température s'étant rafraîchi en cette soirée printanière, il y avait des chaufferettes extérieures pour nous réchauffer et profiter ainsi du calme extérieur. Nous avons opté pour le menu dégustation. Il s'agissait d'un menu six services, avec une grande variété de plats et de saveurs. Ceviche, crabe des neiges, homard et gnocchi, flétan, médaillon de boeuf, et finalement un dessert chocolat et mandarine, agrémenté de madeleines fraîches et de morceaux de chocolats variés.

"I'm almost hesitant to write a review for this place because it is the best-kept secret in Vegas steakhouse dining and I'd prefer to keep it that way!  But oh well, nothing stays secret forever.  This restaurant is exceptional in every way:  the ambiance, the food, the service, and the price.  For $28 you can get a delicious bourbon ribeye, two sides (baked potato, asparagus, broccoli, mac & cheese are some of the choices), salad, and bread service.  You read that correctly:  $28.  Anywhere else it's probably $35-$40 just for the steak, another $8 for each side, and $6 for the salad.  And the food is fantastic, I've been to about a dozen steakhouses in town and I would put Twin Creeks' steaks up against probably anyone's except the Golden Steer and the Luxor's steakhouse (that includes places like Prime at the Bellagio, Blackstone at the Monte Carlo (or whatever it's called now), Kokomo's at the Mirage, Morton's on Flamingo, and  Austin's at Texas Station).  I always get double mac & cheese ar my sides and it's delicious, it tastes like bacon and has breadcrumbs baked on top.  My wife gets the asparagus and says it's the best she's ever had.  Other dishes that our friends have tried include the prime rib, which got rave reviews, and the filet mignon, which was also liked.  Service is quick and friendly and the ambiance is perfect for a steakhouse:  comfortable tables and booths, dim lighting, and a wall that has flowing water on rocks with a color-changing background.  Very relaxing.  I am a big fan of this steakhouse and I recommend it to anyone.",real
This was an amazing experience for all ages.  So many butterflies to look at and take pictures.  If you move slowly they will land and go for a ride.,real
"Live nearby and can't believe I haven't been sooner. Guess because it never seemed busy. Intimate place, great for couples or double date. Very good seafood at reasonable price for a higher end restaurant. Good wine list. GTry the most excellent creme brûlée - one of the best in Madison as they add a little liquor to the sugar before carmelizing the top and it is outstanding. Also, sides are very good and reasonably priced. Service last Friday was excellent. We went in late, and they made us feel very welcome and not rushed at all, which is more than one can say for some of our other high end restaurants in town.",real
We had a great McDonald's lunch - staff courteous and helpful. This was a fairly new location in front of a Sams store- very modern - more like a nice restaurant rather than a fast foods restaurant.,real

"Gonna cut to the chase ... I went there for the pizza, specifically the Sunnyside pizza with the pancetta and eggs.  Idid not go there with high expectations.  A i have tried the sweet  soup that Angelo's calls pizza and the messy, but slightly better tasting stuff Danny Boy's puts out.  I had given up hope for finding decent pizza here.  Yeah, I'm a pizza snob and i believe in thin crusts.  I want pizza, not a casserole.  So, anyway, when they put they pizza down in front of me, i  was totally shocked that someone in Cleveland  knew how to make pizza.  In fact i was delighted.  I was also quite pleased with the mixed green salad i had.  Ate at the bar and the bartender was quick to note that if he didn't have what i wanted, that Bier Market probably did and that he wud be happy to get me whatever from there.  I said a magic word ""Duvel""  ... Ah, sure enuff, The place adjacent had it on draught.  Okay, so I won't have to drive to Columbus for decent pizza anymore and that makes me happy.",real
"Yummy bruschetta & salad. Always a wait in the evenings, but I don't mind it because they serve beverages while you wait! One of my favorite patios :)",real
"Best mexican in the Pittsburgh area, period.  All food is fresh and it's not tex mex or Americanized slop.  Fresh ingredients and good service.  Only Mexican place where you can get fresh jalapeños, not out of a jar or can!",real
Went there for lunch this combine and only took a chance on the street from my house.,fake
Had the special fried rice  and the chicken parm with grilled veggies. Best I've had in Vegas in Chandler. The portions are generous and the prices are fair. I recommend  celebrating our two year anniversary dinner and the appetizers were so good and also plantain soup!!! We will definitely return to this place.,fake
Hands down the best bbq. Including the side dishes and desserts are good. Nice portions super cool staff.,real
Amazing food.  I had the pork shank and said it was great. I want more.,fake
"Amazing!! Dumplings are Let Chigers.... with hot sauce on the side in addition to everybody here.  Really quite genuinely laid back and nice good gyros.  Have seated immediately and everything we tried.  It was more than a special trip, so I was almost sure if the drive-in but was not crazy about the food very well.  I will be back. ..",fake
Everything was excellent!  The staff was very helpful and the bread was amazing!,fake
"I love their hot sandwhiches and the potatoes are delicious. They have a great authentic Vietnamese food for a reasonable price. The dining area is cozy. We have had the half margarita pizza and delivery and several options for sushi in Charlotte.  The food was very tasty, the service was great, and the drinks were delicious. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for delicious options and incredible food. Not to mention the atmosphere is still decent.  But the food is great. Love the decor and the cute patio area. Some of the best BBQ I've ever had",fake
"I went with a large group of women! They handled this large group great! We can be loud so we sat outside. They did was amazing, I'd never eaten there before . I had a roasted sweet tomato sandwich. It was so delicious and filling I took some home. They have such a huge menu to order from. I had so many choices for drinks also. So I tried a few teas then left with a pumpkin chocolate muffin which was so good I bought 2 more to go. This is a trendy cool clean comfy place to go.",real
Love this place!!! I had the ceviche  but the unlimited dragon pecan salad is amazing.  I just wish they had one in June.,fake
My server his name was Tony and he was wonderful this is my first time ever going to Benihana's and I loved it he made the experience great and I will come back just for him but I do have to say the food was amazing and I love every bit of it,real
Love this place - I have been to Saku a number of times and I plan to keep going back on a regular basis. Their Sashimi and (huge) Maki Rolls are the highly recommended. And they all come at a very reasonable price.This place is always busy - you will need to make a reservation.,real
"Where do I start... I love this place!!! I can't believe I'm just writing a review. This is by far one of my fave places to go to that's close to home.The food is always made exactly how I ordered and it is always quick to come out. The bread and butter they give us is flippin amazing. Yes yes I know too much carbs, but every bite is worth it.Last night we sat at the bar and Ian was our bartender. He was super friendly, attentive, and was  able to deliver great customer service. The mugs they use for beers on draft are the best because they are super chilly and keeps the beer at a perfect temperature :)You must try this location! Just a heads up they do get very busy so if you can call ahead or if you don't have the kiddos go straight to the bar no waiting to get seated. Honestly the wait doesn't even bother me because I know I will have a good experience.",real
My favorite restaurant in Toronto. Really cool dining room and service. They're the best part was the food! Love this place!!!!,fake

This is our go-to pizza place. The prices are amazing as well. I have always enjoyed their food and the friendly staff. The customer service is super fast and friendly.,fake
Absolutely the best authentic Mexican food in the area. Beef patties are great and doubles like served with a bit of food you are not vegan. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to go!,fake
Simple reviews come here and eat the bacon cheeseburger every time. I have ate the all you can eat option for after special occasions. Great place to stop and eat.,fake
"The owner knows me when I walk in the door bcuz I'm from Jersey and they originated there..... They took an extra 5 mins for my lunch, they gave me and my wife drinks for free and the owner gave me a free pizza couponBest pizza in Phoenix, hands down",real
The food is always wonderful and American dishes well worth the price.,fake
"Unique atmosphere with a great view of the water. A little loud, but we were there on a Friday night so that can be expected. Our party ordered the Foundry burger, pulled pork sandwich, roasted chicken, black cod, and grilled cheese - all of which were great! Our waitress was prompt and polite. Would definitely recommend!",real
"We love this place.  Their vegetarian and takoyaki is to die for!  This is my go to spot for sushi in Tempe, but the food is amazing. The service here is amazing. We always enjoy my time there and have always had a great time!",fake

Omg this place is great! The food is always tasty and the service is always excellent. This is my favorite place to eat in Tempe.,fake
"Came here on a whim and I wasn't disappointed. Gave Yelp a quick look for hot dog places and found this wonderful place. The staff was very friendly and courteous. The restaurant is small in size, but pretty clean. I ordered the Maxwell Street Spicy Polish, Corn Dog, Spicy Polish, Classic Jumbo and side of fries. The Maxwell was delicious with that homemade coleslaw to go along with the crunch of the fried spicy polish dog. I've never had coleslaw on my dog before, but it was well worth it.This is definitely worth the trip to El Mirage for these delicious dogs! Cant wait to go again!",real
"Amazing food, fantastic service and amazing prices. Been to vegas twice and had the fish tacos. Not a single compliant but the manager was running around and helped us and help.",fake
"First time here. The Pork Loco is excellent. Everything we had was delicious. They did a warm ending on the wall, but everything we tried was very good and customer service was worth the price. They had wonderful service and food. Will definitely be back. Although it is a short location for a table or in a drive thru with great food.  We shall return soon!",fake
"this place is freakin awesome.  run by asians it seems.  very flexible with order.  i got two veggie skewers, a ton of tasty grilled chicken, and rice, for only like 7.50.  i will def come back again.  friendly staff.Only negative is that it's a little bit difficult to find.  just look for the big orange HOME DEPOT sign on the left, if you're heading north on rainbow.i just finished eating the meal and it was amazing.",real
"I won't judge a book by its cover, and this place is always on point!",fake
"Excellent food and service. We had the chicken and steak tacos and I can't compare this review because it's so good and good to have a lovely meal and the bartenders are so friendly and prompt. I would recommend this place to anyone. It's the best chinese food in Scottsdale, their Duck Monster is always super delicious and price is very reasonable. I love the dumplings and the prices are reasonable. I miss the location offering fresh sashimi.",fake
"seriously, the best pizza in Arizona! Always fresh, always delicious! The crust is the best pizza crust in the world! Love you mesa Barro's!",real
Awesome food and amazing service! I didn't eat more than the ones we will go to. Can't wait to come back and try other items.,fake
"Here goes:Two cheeseburgers with ""Secret Sauce"" and pickles (no mustard or ketchup).Medium friesLarge coke.That's pure crack in a bag.  LOVE IT.",real
Went in for breakfast this morning. The woman ready to try the pretzels with ice cream. They look clean & staffs are lovely. I get them because it is burnt on the patio. You can ask for it right the complimentary tea for days.,fake
Ah-mazing food! On your way into the restaurant you'll pass by a fresh herb garden that The Parlor actually uses in their cooking. Wonderful options for building your own pizza or if you're a little more adventurous they have their own creations that are fantastic as well. My husband is pretty picky about his food but with the build-your-own he was able to  create a pizza he loves. The atmosphere is so lovely esp. at night on the patio. We always sit outside whether it's January or July and have always been very comfortable. Great place for a one on one date or with a group of friends!,real
"Hands down best pizza in Las Vegas and in my top 3 best pizza places of all time. Seek it out and eat it. I loved the plain cheese with garlic and onions..sprinkle on some oregano/garlic salt/crushed red and magic in your mouth. Bonus-they are open late...like really late 3am-5am ish depending on demand. March 2012 we stayed in the Cosmo and went exploring the 3rd floor for a snack. We would see people in random places enjoying (really enjoying) a slice of pizza. Something about h the pizza and the people eating it put us in the mood for a slice even though all the other places looked great as well. O.k....where is the pizza coming from? While looking for this pizza joint my eye caught a glimpse of a pin ball machine at the end of a hall and I wanted to check it out. Low and behold it was the pizza place. We got a couple slices and fell in love. I didn't see signage anywhere for a name but assumed it was too new for a name? Later that night we wanted to order a whole pie to bring to our room and couldn't find the place on the Cosmo TV directory. I said ""Its like its secret or something""...my hubby called the desk and asked them and he said ""yeah it has no name..it sa secret..glad you found it"" I think its a very cool and mysterious concept. Anyway he connected us to their phone and we ordered a whole pie for our room....we also each had one more slice as we were getting in the cab to go to the airport to fly back home. Anyway...go you will enjoy it :)If I could give 4 1/2 I would only because none of their offerings (at-least they weren't yet) are organic and that's a bummer for me. However its vacation and I loosen up a bit.",real
"A large selection of toppings. Wife had a banana cream pie for dessert and it was delicious, and it was so good I got to satisfy my order!  The owners were attentive and staying super busy on a Sunday and the other night we had the best beef and broccoli in large with some of the best we have 'visited.  I usually order the Pineapple Fried Rice & Butter Burger Too. We love it!",fake
Their tacos beat Bigo Taco's on Mesa Dr/Broadway by a long shot. The beans were amazing!,real
"We just got here last night with friends and family here for several years. The ambiance is great, the food is delicious and the service is excellent. The menu is so quick and friendly. They have great healthy options as well. I'll be back again.",fake
"It was my first night of a long awaited vacation and. Friend suggested this place for dinner.   I had no idea what the food was like here or anything about the restaurant.  Silly me should have checked yelp!   I met him at the restaurant and he explained Brazilian Steakhouse to me.  Said to ask for small pieces so I could try everything!  I told him o was starving so this would be a great treat considering this was my first meal in 12 hours!The waiter explained the ""button"". Turn it over to have the servers come and flip it to stop.  They offered us a visit to the ""salad bar"" which was loaded with tasty treat. Mushrooms, olives, salad, salami etc.  I could have gotten full just eating that!I returned to my seat and the treat began.   all types of meat and sausages were brought to us on skewers.  The first few skewers I just had the server slice me a normal size and my friend warned me..small pieces!   I lost track of how many different meats we ate all prepared and sliced differently.  Everything they brought was incredibly delicious!  The lamb, the ribeye, cowboy steak etc...just an amazing sensory delight on the tongue!   I had seconds on the sausage as it was so perfectly cooked and seasoned.   I had thirds on the ribeye!!   I've already recommended this to place to three friends heading to Vegas!  Definitely worth the drive from the strip and the mall itself a great visit!",real
"THE BEST CAROLINA CLASSIC BURGER ON PLANET EARTH! - Ridiculously small restaurant: SRO.- Take-out only. - CASH ONLY. - Hours: PLEASE NOTE: Brooks is only open from 7:30 AM until 2:00 PM. They lock the door at 1:00 PM, but the tiny take out window, to the left of the entrance is open until 2 o'clock PM. I found this out the hard way.....- Seating: There are no seats inside or outside the restaurant. There are elevated communal wooden tables in the shade of trees. - Parking: There is a generous amount of parking in their gravel lot. - Conclusion: Their ATW burgers are SERIOUSLY good! - PS: One time, after returning back to work, I took a ruler and measured the thickness of the hamburger patties, AFTER being cooked. One burger was fully one inch thick and the other burger was 7/8"" - amazing. - PSS: Ordering their burger ""all the way,"" is the ONLY way to get the maximum goodness of mustard, chili, and onion atop their THICK, hand formed, never frozen, hamburger patties. - PSSS: If Brooks would put CHILI CHEESE FRIES on their menu, they would make a fortune. Their fries are normally super crispy, skin on, and salty. Their homemade chili is out of this world. Top this with a liberal application of Velveeta  or Cheese Whiz melted cheese. You could sell these for $3 per container, as fast as you could make them.",real
The best Indian food in town. Great service. Get some good beer,fake
"I love the Valley Ho! I threw my sister's bachelorette party in Scottsdale and the Valley Ho immediately came to mind. I knew the weather was going to be amazing outside so I was excited to see that they had the Terrace Suite. The Terrace Suite was a swanky, retro style suite with a balcony/terrace that was 850 square feet! It was as big (if not bigger) than the room itself. The Suite was next to the pool and it was the perfect suite for me to set up a candlelit dinner outside. The bathroom was huge, with enough mirror for everyone to get ready and a huge bathtub and shower. The bed was extremely comfortable and the service was amazing. I didn't run into any problems during our stay and the bellboy was very nice and helpful with any baggage that we needed carried up the stairs (they don't have an elevator). We got our nails done on the terrace while we sipped on some Dom Perignon mimosas, it was awesome, just as I planned. They have plenty of parking if you do not wish to valet, which was more conveniant given the location our room was closer to the lot than the front desk. The service was great, they would ask if we needed more towel every day (which we did), so wonderful! I would recommend this Hotel to anyone and everyone!",real
"I enjoyed every second of my meal here and can't comprehend why anyone would write a bad review. If you want to dress up and spend $200 on a meal, go to Sinatra. If you want free wine, fun decor, an accordion player that plays at your table and food like your Italian grandmother used to make, then come here.I got the Chicken Cacciatore and it was better than some other fancy places I've been to. I can't say I love the Marinara, which came with my boyfriends Veal Parmesan (it's on the sweet side), but it wasn't bad.You start off with a basket of hot buttery garlic bread, followed up with a big bowl of Italian salad with their excellent house Italian dressing (or Minestrone soup if you want it) and then you get your meal. I did think the plates were a little small... I would have loved more pasta to use with that delicious Cacciatore sauce.Your meal is followed up with a hot chocolate-esque flavored Cappucino. By this point you would have realized you're not getting Starbucks here.Gordy the accordion player comes to every table and asks you where you're from. Then he'll hit a few keys and attempt a song related to your state. Ask him to play more and he will, just don't forget to tip! I only had the red wine, but for free wine, it's not half bad!This place really reminded me of my Italian grandmother and the food she used to cook up every Sunday. I'd take that over a $200 meal at some posh Italian joint anyday. Our flight got canceled and we already plan to go back before we leave.",real
We come here once a week on average. Everything on the menu is OUTSTANDING! Great service - great local place to grab something good to eat at reasonable prices!,real

I asked Javier if they had a mole enchilada dish and if it was any good! He told me me ""very good""! He was not wrong. Just the right amount of sweet and spicy. The service was also great! Highly recommend this place!",real
"My friend and I were looking for a good brunch spot on saturday and saw that this spot had a good reputation. Parking sucked its meters all around, but it's hard to find a good spot that's close. Parking is probably the only issue I found with this place.It's a great environment, everyone there is having a fun time just by the looks on their faces. The waitress was great, since it was my first time she gave me some good info on a couple menu items. I ordered the Southern Comfort, big fan of biscuits and gravy for brunch. The order came out warm, fluffy biscuits with a poached egg and savory sausage gravy. Price was reasonable for the amount of food I got, and I left full. I will definitely be returning next time I'm in the city!",real
"So glad to find a place with warm cooked meal passed 9pm. Customer service and service is very very friendly and welcoming. Food absolutely delicious, drunken noodles beef and #19 (something hog)! I don't come to Vegas often (1-2x a year) but when I do I will be coming back here!",real
Very very delicious restaurant. You have to try out the lambs. With triple rices. It's a place where you can bring your own wine. You can have fun with your friends with your own drink. Sadly my colleagues and I didn't get the terrace. We could enjoy the sun and nice weather.,real

"I came here for my birthday with my boyfriend, and everything was just perfect. The service, the food, and the environment was top notch. Yunaghi only offers a tasting menu and we decided to do the $100- 9 course one. Although in pictures it appears as very little food, but i was actually full by the 7th course. The dishes were all so unique, and the plating of each dish is just beyond me. All ingredients were so fresh and high quality - I've never tasted a sweet cherry tomato as good as the one here! ^^' You can truly enjoy and appreciate the flavours of each ingredient.The service was very welcoming and friendly. The staff was very knowledgeable on their menu items and drinks. Each dish presented in front of you, and then explained - answering any questions you might have. Its a very small restaurant so the staff was very attentive, and service was quick. I love how the restaurant is so small, with quiet music in the background. It felt very personal and private which really sets the mood for a nice quiet dinner with your significant other. I think the restaurant seats about 25 people. Last but not least, for my birthday they made me a special dessert and sang happy birthday to me. It really ended the dinner/night on a good note and made it a special and memorable experience. I would definitely come back when they change up their menu again. And I highly recommend trying this place out for any special occasion.",real
Get the Hawaiian medium rare like an old school diner.  This restaurant is super friendly and welcoming.  The meat is so good and the sides are great.  The best I've had in a long time.

"I am not a person to write reviews on restaurants.  I always read them but have never felt the need to share how awesome a place was, until today.  We went to Tsuki Izakaya.  The manager was incredibly awesome! So nice,  he kept giving us free snacks to try with our polar beers.  They are one of the few restaurants in Toronto that carries sapporo Polar beer.  It's beer with a frozen beer flavored head that keeps the beer ice cold until the last drop.  As for the snacks,  they have the best black cod I have ever tasted.  I'm not foreign to sushi,  I actually go out for it pretty regularly, but this cut of cod (that was cooked)  was so tender and flavorful that we both ordered a second helping.  Basically,  you need to try this place.",real

But what was more impressive was the fresh quality food that was served! It was hot off the stove when it was served! The flavor of the pork was so delicious! I couldn't stop eating it! The cream cheese Rangoon was upsetting, that I only got ONE! It's by far the tastiest one over ever had! The egg drop soup was delicious too, it had so much flavor! I'm definitely excited to have found this place.",real

I even tried to come home and copy their Roasted Green Chili Baked potato... I didn't do it justice, so I will need to go back and have it again. The place is small, and the parking non-existent, but they have complimentary valet and that helps. Get there early or make sure to make reservations. LOVED THIS PLACE! Loved everything about it!",real
Fantastic place to eat. Wow! Service and food were great. We plan to come back again and again.,fake

"Some of the best food we have EVER eaten!  The hamachi crudo was phenomenal, the bread, oh my!  Duck fat potatoes were off the hook!  Crispy oysters and the pork sugo pasta were both fantastic.  Everything was seasoned to perfection and the wait staff and employees were so nice and welcoming.  LOVED this place from start to finish!",real
"Not sure which one came out first, their food truck or their shop but either way both are amazing.  The menu is short but food isn't short on taste at all. Located in a converted garage, it's a unique place to hit up for lunch or dinner. Much like the food truck dishes, single portion dishes might not be very filling and it could add up really quickly on your tab. They have great tasting desserts loaded on a cart that's almost a must.",real
"The pokey bowl is like a ""make your own sushi roll, but in a bowl""   Everything is made to order and taste great. Definitely worth trying",real
Very nice vibe. Good coffee too. Thank you for staying a bit to eat pizza and approved them to shame. Fast service and awesome patio for good neighborhood feel.,fake
Stopped off here on a recommendation from a local. We were not dissapointed. It was delicious. The best brunch we have had in a long time.,real
Fantastic tacos -- for Las Vegas. Also try the mulitas: they're like a taco quesadilla.Red taco sauce is really good.,real
This place has some of the best tasting chicken and bacon sausages around.  This is my new go to when I'm in Vegas.  Usually a 10-oz try it out!,fake
Used to go to soccer part of town and this place gets the perfect regular house with the name.,fake
"What a great experience. Cava did not disappoint! Our waiter was on point the entire night recommending our entire meal with wine pairings for each course. The decor was so nice, not too loud, and a great crowd. I would 100% go back to try different variations of their menu. One more thing, the broken plates, cups, and dish wall was a wonderful decor piece! Well done everyone!",real

"It is my second time eating here. I am not a local so i cant enjoy this place as much as i wish i could so when i am in Vegas i make sure i eat here at least once. The food is great! Some things are not completely ""authentic"" but its as close as you can get. The table-side guacamole is so good. I has the beef flautas this time and they were so good. The place is not cheap but the portions are huge. The agua de Jamaica was delicious! The bus boys/waiters are on it! As soon as my cup was half full they immediately came to refill it, and when i say immediately i mean it... They are so attentive and i never had to ask for anything since they offered way before i even thought about it. We enjoy eating here so much because the place looks so nice and authentic, the service is great and all the food we have tried has really surprised us so far. Definitely recommend this place.",real

"Almost a year since I've first visited this place and I'm absolutely amazed how the food quality is still top notch, portions are still generous and the staff are friendly as ever. Hands down best shawarma place in York region (possibly all of GTA)",real
The best steak I've ever had. Excellent food and even better service. Some of the best food I've ever had in my life. Hummus appetizers prepared on a second stomach.  Heard so much about this one I find it in the Winter Washington high school burger nachos is really good as well. Will definitely be back!,fake
Great food the meat is fresh and delicious! I usually go on Sunday and there is something for everyone and I can see why they are making me feel like I am in Vegas!!! And don't miss this place!,fake
Excellent customer service! Great food! Went for early dinner on a Saturday night and the place was not that packed.,real
"the only reason i speak of the mistake  is to give the praise to the food and the team , thank you , there was a forgotten peta and humas , a bit of time later they had upgrade to one more great pita. So i must say the food is very good and the service is 100% in my book",real
Great bakery - highly recommend this place! Outstanding service and the food was soooo good. I would definitely come back,fake

"I have to say,I have been going to this ristorante for the past twenty years with my family.  Every time we go there we have the same server.  We are always greeted well and the alfredo is amazing, and so is the sea bass,  the halibut, and  veal chop.  The homemade house salad dressing is one of a kind too.  The new bar/ lounge area is nice and the pianist is a nice touch.  Love Christo's.",real
Best wings I've ever had !! Drove in Cali and was pleasantly surprised ... Can't speak for the rest of the menu but the wings are ridiculous,real
"I love this place..something for everyone. For Garlic Lovers - the garlic dip will NOT disappoint. You will ward off all vamps guaranteed. Philly cheesesteak/chicken lovers...unforgettable. Lemon chicken salad amazing (HUGE grilled  chicken strips), tuna pizza..odd maybe..but delicious all the same. Need I go on? .the only thing i didn't care for was the veggie burger oddly enough. For an exceptional veggie burger I would steer you towards Four Peaks Brewery. But other than that they are spot on everytime all the time. Can't go wrong!",real
"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto.  Food is always spectacular, bar area is great if your own your own of with a buddy and do not feel like sitting in the dining room.Food is consistent, yummy, craving it as I am writing this review.",real
"Finally a nice, not too slummy, not too fancy, Chinese restaurant with really good food!  This place just opened up.  I used a mailer coupon the first time but the food was so good I decided to come back again.  The hot and sour soup is actually hot and sour..and really yummy (I'm pretty picky with my soups). My husband and I also had Peking Duck - the duck was crispy and juicy as it should be and the buns were soft and fresh.  We ordered the shrimp lo mein for my kids...a little salty for my taste but my kids enjoyed it!  The staff there is superfriendly and professional - they brought extra crispy noodles because my son told the waiter the noodles were yummy!  I will definitely come back again.",real
"Hands down my favorite place in the valley to eat! I've eaten here a dozen times and never been disappointed.  I work in the industry and cannot say enought about the food at this place.  I also consider this to be a secret weapon with the dating scene.  I tell every one of my guy friends that this is the place for a first date.  The patio atmosphere is a shoe-in with the ladies.  Don't doubt me, try it.  You'll thank me later.  If you don't try the house of tricks than you suck!",real
"The best little hidden treasure.  We had a great breakfast.  Our waitress. Dina, was AMAZING!!!!  We were in town from Mi. and found this place on YELP.  I would love to go back again.",real
This place has become our go-to place for my bff and their first time. The food always tastes fresh & sandwiches are to die for. Service is always good. We always visit while at the door to the Trip with excellent service. I highly recommend this place. The food is delicious!,fake
"Food was amazing! Just what we wanted, maybe better! We hate hate hate when food is greasy and tasteless but it seems that's all you get at most places.... Not this place! No greasy food! All flavor and no grease! Seriously I even looked at my hash browns which would be forgivable should there be some grease. To my surprise their wasn't even residue on the plate! In fact they were so good I ate 80%of them without ketchup and then when I finally reached for ketchup out of habit I realized I had somewhat ruined them by putting such an inferior topping on my hash browns. They even had chipotle chulula.... OMG seriously everything was amazing. Wish there was one in so cal.... Say close to Murrieta;);)",real
Real buffet and very pleasantly surprised with the food the flavors and the atmosphere. Finally found one that I have ever been to. The service was amazing. I would recommend this place to anyone that likes lunch time.,fake
"Best buffet on The Strip! Not to mention it's also located inside the best hotel in Vegas. Prices vary on the day of week, but the brunch buffet on Tuesday was only $22, which included unlimited champagne. What a deal!Their international selection is absolutely mouthwatering. Your eyes will definitely be bigger than your stomach, so make sure you pace yourself. Hightlights included pastas served in mini skillets, fried chicken wings in mini fry baskets, awesome carving station, giant made-to-order omelettes and a beautiful array of desserts.Save the buffet for your last day. Perfect cure for those hangovers!",real
Seated immediately which is fun. Delicious meals. Comfortable seating and food. We will be back.,fake
"Stopped here before an Indians game. The way they do beer is probably the coolest method I've ever seen at a bar--put money on a card, tap the card above the tap, and pour away. Not to mention, the price per ounce is ridiculously cheap. I had several Summer Shandys, which typically run you at least $4 a bottle or draft, and that's being kind, and filling my cup to the brim each time was right around the $2 mark. So no waiting at a crowded bar for service plus cheap, quality beer?! Count me in. Then the food...we went for the chili cheese fries and Mac and cheese balls. I've had Mac n cheese bites and balls at different places and they're always good, but these were honestly the best. They were huge and had a spicy bite to them, too. The chili cheese fries were great too, nothing tops curly fries in my book. I wanted to try the pepperoni mozzarella sticks because that seems like a fun twist, but two apps was enough for our first visit. The place is huge and open and I love the rustic/industrial feel. You can write on the walls and beams with sidewalk chalk, which I'm sure will tell some interesting stories once the place has been open for a while. There's also ping pong and bocce ball upstairs, how fun. I'd love to return and with WES's location to Progressive and my boyfriend's work, I'm sure we will.",real
"I've been eating at this chain for years! I fluent this location more than the others.  The food is fantastic. The salsa is perfect. To the yelpers who rate this place low I say try some of the places all around the states! This place always has good service, great food with huge portions. Their RICE and CHIPS  are some of the best I have experienced! !!! When visiting this restaurant,  they never disappoint!",real
The best chicken karaage in the City. Good for dine in and enjoy sundays.,fake
"I love this place and the space is the best American I have ever tasted. I have had whatever you could want, and they are amazing. They are always super friendly and on point. I dont live around the corner and would recommend this place to anybody who is always full, not hot, and so nice.",fake
"I have been here multiple times and have sat in both the dining room and bar area. If you are willing to splurge they have great steak and seafood! Creative menus and happy hour options that are cheaper! The staff is attentive and friendly! My only complaint is they could use a more diverse menu with more options, but they put so much quality into the options they do have and it is well worth the price!",real
"The food was great, the spice is bomb! I would definitely recommend this place!",fake
Food was super delicious. French onion burger and fried pickles were fantastic.Decor is casual but comfortable. Haven't tried anything else on the menu.,real
Holy cow this pizza was amazing!  Highly recommend.  I didnt have to wait long for my list for a while ago.,fake

"This was the first casino I've been to and I love it. It's always crowded, but very clean. The architecture of the building and its decor is so pretty; also, the arrangement of the slot machines and tables was very well thought out. I really like the atmosphere of the bars and how fast you're waited on by the servers if you order from a slot machine. The whole staff is very personable. I love downtown Cleveland in general, and I think this casino adds a nice touch.",real

Great Hostess and Denise!I always get the modern tasting menu choice. The coffee and cocktails are great and helpful. I highly reccommend this as authentic tasting Valley Milk tea!!!!!!  The kind of space with a show with the Bellagio fountains!   We loved all the games that were entertaining and special.  Thank you Alberto for the hospitality,fake
Great place to eat. Food is great and service is always good. Not to be missed.,fake

Amazing vegetation/vegan food! It was perfect. My mom has been a vegetarian for 30 years and is convinced that this was the best vegetarian food she's ever had! Please open a location in Toronto! We would be forever grateful! Definitely worth checking out. Fantastic food for meat eaters and plant based dieters alike. So much yum!,real
Amazing as always! The burgers are delicious and so is the Brunswick fries. So yummy!,fake
"Great seafood, service, and food. I think this is definitely the place to eat in Scottsdale.",fake
"They have very unique and interesting options (in a good way) for pour over coffee. If you want a pour over, go here! There isn't much else that comes close to comparing in this part of town.  The environment is warm and it was very busy. Baristas are also just the right amount of sassy so you know they know what their doing but they also care about you enjoying their creation and want to get you what you want.",real
I just love this place! It's a sit down place. The service is great and the food is amazing. You get a lot of food for the price and for the price. We will definitely be back!,fake
"The food was top notch, the staff was very friendly, and the food was great. I'll definitely be back.",fake
"Great quality sushi.We had the fatty tuna here (Toro) and it was a bit pricey at MP $15 a serving, but it was well worth it. The rolls are exactly described and the service was very good. We were not expecting service and food this good north of the 215. We ordered the Ex Wife roll and that was very tasty and filling. Altogether it was $50-$65 including a couple of rolls, the order of Toro and a couple of handrolls. We are definitely going to come back if we are in the area.",real
"Love this place the food is excellent and the prices are great! If you want some good food and fun, great prices, great service!",fake
"This was one of the best places to eat when visiting Pittsburgh with the bar. So accommodating, experienced. Will definitely go there again.",fake
"If you hate buffets the Bacchanal probably won't change your mind about them but it's a gorgeous place to eat with family and the service is great. Basically it's the best buffet money can buy but don't anticipate being able to try everything. Pace yourself. Seating is fantastic, decor is wonderful, food is high quality but not the highest quality so don't go in expecting lobster tails and filet mignon steaks. Good choices all around, so if you come with a group you're guaranteed that there'll be something for everybody. Expect a long wait but it's worth it!",real
"I don't know if we just lucked out on a good night of acts but I liked it better than Absinthe!We went on a Wednesday for the 8:00 show. I don't want to give anything away so I won't name the acts, it ruins the surprise factor. Besides I took an oath.We had some drinks from the bar at the show, The Washington Apple and The Whisky Smash. Both were excellent drinks, the apple was more on the sweet side. Yes they are pricey drinks but what show drinks aren't expensive, at least your getting a well made drink by someone that knows what they are doing.Before the show I felt like I couldn't tell cast from guests, there were some characters in the audience that made for good people watching. Things and people for the show are being pushed around, readying for the show as you wander around looking for the bathroom. There's just so much eye stimulation going on.Our seats weren't that hot but we didn't pay for them so I wasn't complaining. +1 for not having to sit on those folding chairs. (My boney ass is thankful)After the show we went over to the restaurant/bar to check it out. It was packed. A band plays while some of the show's cast put on a show of their own before the next show starts. There were a lot of people eating and at the bar drinking.I definitely want to check it out again, maybe even sit down for dinner. Let's make it a family tradition!",real
Try their Italian Beef sandwich with jelly tots to fill you up  the noodles comes out to perfection. The restaurant is always clean and staff is friendly. Have spent Farm out of town to try and give them a try. The prices are incredible. A welcome ndigir small bite as well as service is wonderful.,fake
"Eleven has become my Go-To for a perfect dining experience.  I just celebrated my birthday there and they went to great lengths to make it wonderful: impeccable service, delectable food and drink, and lovely ambiance, even giving us our own small dining room off the main dining area. If you have an occasion to celebrate or are looking for the perfect Sunday brunch, Eleven is the place!",real
"This place is soooo good. Some of the food falls into the prestigious category of cuisine that makes it's eaters stop talking. Not because their marriage has become stale, but because the food is too fantastic to stop shoveling it in. I also love that they feature art from local artists and that some of it is for sale.I didn't absolutely love the paella... It needed more flavor but I absolutely loved everything else.",real
My go to spot for sushi. Food is more for your stomical crust as well. Mala sauce is incredible & the service is always top notch.,fake
"Had a really great meal. The owner came over to talk to and talked that and many great of the menu.  The breakfast was excellent as well.   The chef pride was a little different with kind of reviews but the food was excellent! The service was excellent. I don't even like taken out on a warmer visiting from Vegas. Every time that my husband and I were very happy with the food there and most of all the food is fresh and delicious. The waitress was very knowledgable about the place. We had a delicious dessert after a day of brunch and loved it for a week.  We ordered the steak sandwich, both were amazing.  Will definitely return next time I'm in town.",fake
Great place to visit while in Scottsdale.  Get a veggie oatmeal.  Do this place enough!  You will not be disappointed.,fake
"Our waitress was very attentive and friendly during brunch. Since I just recently moved to the south, I had never had chicken and waffles before. She recommended I get that dish with a side of sausage gravy, since I am more a fan of savory dishes than sweet. This dish was absolutely incredible. I have not ordered chicken and waffles anywhere else since this occasion because I am afraid it won't compare!",real
"I'm going to be honest , in and out is what I wanted but the line was soooooo long so I ventured into taco bell Mark is great !!!!! he was pleasant, inviting and accomidating. my fault I forgot there was sour cram on the gordita  very clean facility and great guest service .

"I'm a huge Japanese cuisine and Sushi connoisseur so I had to write a review after the amazing lunch today at Hana.  Hana is not your typical Japenese restaurant, it's the real deal and offers an extensive menu.  A few of the items we ordered were the Salmon & Albacore Sashimi and it was so fresh.  They provide both fresh and wasabi spread which is wonderful.  Their Albacore was truly some of the best I've ever had which was topped with browned scallions, and avocado slices. Hana is Japenese owned and operated restaurant which explains the attention to detail, as well as the amazing menu.  Rick, their Sushi chef prepared our sushi and it was beautifully prepared, as well incredibly fresh.  I also want to give a shout out to our waiter today, Jake, who took great care of us and did a really great job providing us with some really wonderful recommendations. It's alway so nice when the wait staff knows the menu.  I was also pleased to find out that Hana also offers BYOB, and even provides a wine bucket and glasses. I will have already recommended Hana to many of my friends and this will definitely be one of my regular places to eat.",real

If you just order standards like the enchiladas or tacos you may not be as impressed.Salsa and chips are also wonderful.",real

i am a local and took advantage of the half off during dec. the prices of cleo's  tapas were not too bad.  the food was exceptional.  the service was great.  i have been back twice since their half off offer and will continue to come back as long as they don't charge for parking! refuse to go to strip casinos that i have to pay for parking!!! even got lucky playing craps a few times after dinner!,real
"A few years ago there was another place that used the same spicy indian type sauce in the shawarma`s called ali baba (not affiliated with the current chain). Until that closed down I discovered this place. I have frequented this place quite a few times and their taste is always consistent and fresh. Ofcourse, I only recommend it because of that sauce they put in the shawarma - its not just table-top hot sauce, its an indian style sauce which makes the shawarma taste unique. There are normally line-ups in this small little place. People working there seem nice and the place is very inexpensive (2 shawarmas for $5.99).",real
Excellent food and service. I have been coming here for years. The staff are always so friendly and helpful.

"When I first moved to Phoenix in 2006 I was so moved by the exemplary service and high quality of McDonald's food at this location that I wrote an email letting them know how I feel. I felt this was the best served, freshest tasting McDonald's food I had experienced and the staff was always great and professional. Because of my praising email, they mailed me two free extra value meal coupons. Very nice. All McDonald's should be like this one. I recognize it is weird reviewing chains (especially a McDonald's), but this one I feel deserved it. Still don't like it? Tough.",real

Huge servings and their 2 for 1 shawarma deal is amazing, i always had the 1 chicken 1 beef shawarma in the middle of the night (taxis line up here in the evening as the food is really good) on late nights and really starving situation, their shawarma platter will fix you up for sure!! I live just around the corner so i am a regular here, at least 2x a week",real

This is my favorite pizza spot. We usually order a large w/pepperoni &  extra cheese.  They cook it perfect everytime.,real
"A great spot for fun dining and good food. Don't freak out when they try to put the bib on you. It's for your own good when you start digging into the bucket of sauce and seafood that you ordered.Get the sha-bang sauce. It'll be the best choice you'll ever make in your life. I usually order it with their fresh shrimp. Add on some sausage that highly complement the sauce which in turn brings out the flavor in them. And the finishing touch - corn! I know it sounds strange and my dining companion didn't believe me either (he became a devout believer after one bite), but when the buttery sweet corn on the cob is covered with the sauce, there are simply no words to explain the explosion of flavors that makes you think ""wow, I've never had corn like this before!"" That's right, you haven't had corn before boiling crab.",real
"Stumbled upon this gem while in Charlotte.  Gorgeous decor, fantastic service, romantic atmosphere, and delicious food!",real

"Com Tam is real authentic​ Vietnamese food with really good bun bo hue and pho! The bun bo hue has so much flavor and it's so much better than what I've had in Houston, TX. I've had my fair share of Viet food living in Houston. Definitely tastes like a home cooked meal! The service was really great and the portions were  good amount of food. I was stuffed! The pho was really good and the noodles were awesome! Also, they smoothies were made with real fruit. I've tried durian, avocado, and coconut and they were delicious and it's does not taste like it was made from powder. I would definitely recommend this place and come back the next time I visit Toronto!",real
"This place has some of the best and fresh Traditional Korean snacks available. They have this crazy assembly line-like machinery that pops out fresh Hodo Kwajas by the clock. They also have many different filling options as well as other snacks like the syrup filled pancakes.

With every trip to Toronto (2 hours of driving, tolls and border), I make every effort to stop by. This place is as good as it gets!",real

"Sad they closed down the one at Paradise Valley Mall area but I get it, this one is just a couple miles north. LOVE ISLANDS! BEST BURGER - Hawaiian, best fries anywhere and best ranch. Lol they cut their fries fresh everyday, make their own salsa and marinate their own chicken. They also make their own ranch. Delicious ! Yum yum yum. Can't get a better burger anywhere else. Juicy flavorful and the bun (whole wheat) is divine.",real
"I really think this buffet at Las Vegas deserves 5+ stars! Absolutely the best buffet you can have at Vegas! Large vareity of food and seafood menu on weekends & holidays! My personal favorite item there is the warm cooked crab legs with melted butter! I dont think many if any other buffet serves their crab legs the way M Resort does it! Price has gone up quite a bit since I first started going (a couple years back), but even with the price going up many many people like myself still go back everytime I'm at Vegas!More other pros about this buffet is there are FREE beer and house wine (both white and red)! You cant beat that anywhere else! Service is usually pretty good. Always refilling drinks at the right time never really had to wait for the waiter/waitress to bring something you requested.One big down side about this place is the ridiculous wait time. I mean on just an average weekend you can be in line for about 1 to 2 hours. If you are thinking about a holiday weekend, hahaha good luck because I've seen/heard of wait times over 3 hours!",real
"Awesome good Great location. We had the steak sandwich, meatball, and entree. Will be back again!",fake
The best burger in the valley that we ordered we wanted to try many people in menu.  She got the sizzling rice with red sauce. Glad we did.  Good value for the amount of food the size of the menu to choose from. The prices are very reasonable and they have a mommacle touch.,fake
Great time to try out this place and decide to go here. Online ordering is an ice cold beer.,fake
Excellent food and great service!  Great place to bring friends and family.,fake
Seated right away. Nice and clean. Staff was very friendly. I will most definitely be coming back here next time.,fake
"I just had the greek salad and pita w/ hummus... my life is now complete...if i would die this second, I'd be ok with it. Seriously though, i don't know if it was because i was starving it tasted so good or what but it was BOMB. I am gonna say that some olives in my greek salad would've been nice but no biggie. I will definitely be back, like maybe tomorrow..thank you Pita House!",real
"Service was fantastic, greeted me right when I walked in, was a nice touch.  Very clean, food was spectacular!  Wow!  And I'm from NJ so you know I take my Chinese food seriously!  Couldn't believe the price!  Very reasonable for made to order.  No MSG too.  They have the coke machine so have every selection imaginable!!!!  I strongly recommend!",real
"Omg, I wish they have a Lawry's here in Northern California!!! I love this place, you must get their prime rib if you are dining here. I ordered the California cut and the meat literally melts in your mouth. The first time I dined here I was so awed by the chef pushing a huge cart around with big slab of prime ribs. Also, your prime rib comes with salad, mash potatoes, and Yorkshire pudding. Definitely one of the best and reasonably priced meal out here in Vegas. We took an uber from planet Hollywood and it cost us 7 dollars to get to Lawry's. Well worth my 7 dollars for uber and the price of dinner was amazing for the amount of food!",real
This place is super cool. Friendly service. Always fresh food. Plus from the family too eye pleasant and attentive. The beef shawarma was perfectly cooked. The service was great as well. We will definitely be back!,fake
Went again..man yay for all you can eat sushi..their habachi is the best....so yummy and they actually have yum yum sauce....best place for all you can eat because they include other items even though they charge you extra. But still a great place to eat and drink and enjoy with family and friends. Everyone is friendly attentive and they try and get you in as fast as they can even when busy. Loved this place right when it opened and love how they have stayed open and more people have found this great spot. Come and enjoy!,real
"It bothers me to no end that, in the nearly 6 years I've been coming to the Phoenix area every quarter that I never bothered to ask the folks at Chicago Gyros up in East Union Hills (yeah... the one way the heck up in Desert View) whether they had any other locations.  I guess I just assumed that they were shop kind of place and these amazing, delicious gyros would have to be a treat for when I was driving up by there.Well... I finally found out they have other locations.  Like this one.  And the food is just as food.  Same perfectly seasoned lamb and beef gyro meat, served with onions and house tzatziki.  Same warm, thick, super soft, never stale pita.  Same slightly underwhelming fries that are probably okay to skip if you're not a fries kind of person.I will say this location is smaller than the Union Hills locations, food is a bit slower to come up, and while I have no qualms about the service here, the folks I've encountered working at the other location regularly seem a lot friendlier.  At least much more personable.The Chicago Gyro lunch special - with a self-serve soft drink and either fries or a salad will come out at under $8.  Still a great deal.",real
"Great spot for locals when you want an excellent dinner without dealing with The Strip! I hadn't been here in a long time but when a friend wanted to take me to a nice dinner for my birthday but when I told her I wasn't in the mood to deal with The Strip she suggested Hank's. I jumped all over it as it's really convenient access from where I live and quite frankly I really wanted to catch part of the Sharks playoff game. I got there first and went to the bar to wait for my friend. I was happy as a clam to see the Sharks game on. So I bellied on up to the bar. As I walked in I noticed a customer with a frosty Moscow Mule. I was all over it and it was as refreshing as it looked served proper in a copper mug. My friend soon joined and although we had dinner reservations we opted to eat at the bar so I could continue to watch the Sharks win. The awesome thing to note was that the service and attention we got was just as on par as if we had sat at a table. We indulged to say the least starting with a bottle of rosé and oysters and ending with amazing desert (Go for the toffee cake!) washed down with frangelico. Oh yeah... There was an amazing ribeye, salad, sides and Pinot Noir in between. Everyone from the bartenders to the manager made us feel like queens. And what's even better was there was live music as well. Once we finished our amazing meal (and finished watching the Sharks win) we went and sat at the bar that is custom made around the piano. Oh and there might have been another glass of rosé... Such a perfect night! Will definitely not wait so long to return!",real
Love love love this place! Great service and food. The food is good and service is always good. This place reminds me of a strip mall opens up buffet. I had the chicken sandwich (and I let my knowledge of their fries). Bartender was also fantastic even with our show move. The food was so good and the staff was friendly and kind. The food was very good and it was my first time and I loved it! It was a little slow to close and let me pay for the saisannisa from the cafe. This is as good as it gets!,fake
Absolutely the best buffet I've ever been and I must say that sweet potato fries and the grilled chicken wrapped in bacon. Fries and salads are great!,fake
"I've been to Simi's about 10 times since around the time it opened and they have always had excellent food.  The servers are very attentive and want to make sure the food is satisfactory.  I have nothing bad to say, the pho here is my favorite and I haven't had a better orange chicken.  I'm very pleased with the service at Simi's.  Keep up the great work!",real
Simply delicious food. Great customer service. I had a barbacoa burrito and my mom and i were too full. The service was friendly and courteous. A very good feel of a few other places in the city.,fake
Awesome place to kick back and drink here at the table and have never had a bad meal there.,fake
One of our favorite places to eat. We especially enjoyed the truffle fries when we walked in and made sure we were good. Can't wait to go back!,fake
Awesome brunch! Great service and clean restaurant. I had the beet curry with chicken and it's delicious. I will be back for that. The restaurant is deceiving. Very friendly staff. Highly recommended.,fake
Stumbled across this place on a visit to Vegas.  SO glad we did. We will be back every time we come to town from now on. The menu is unique with many healthy options as well as more traditional items - something for everyone - and their shakes are incredible. I had one that had Nutella and bananas and it was so good - not normally a big ice cream shake drinker but this was so good that after I finished mine I went after my kids shakes too. . Can't wait to go back.,real
"Cheap beer at happy hour but wings were cold, barely warm.  The artichoke dip was good.  Service was decent but not great!!  So the waitress asked how things were and took the wings off without us asking so all is good!  Then the bar mgr asked what game we wanted.  Worked for me!",real
"Great service, great food, and great atmosphere. We've had the food at this restaurant and they have many options on the menu and all worth it.",fake
"Great food always.  I sometimes order with post net home dilevery.  I like the chili shrimp and hummus plate,   The dark chocolate flourless cake is supper rich for someone who craves dark chocolate.",real
"I really love this place! Their drinks aren't overly sweet, but you're able to add more sweetness if you like too! I also like how their taro isn't too sweet to where it tastes like fake taro flavoring. My favorite drinks include:-taro milk green tea (hot with no boba)-it's not too sweet and the tea that they use is very yummy!-mango snow slush is also a favorite too! it has such a yummy mango flavor! the only downside is the location of where it's at, very busy & usually hard to find parking. but it's not a deal breaker for me, not all the time lol",real
"THIS IS THE HARRY POTTER CAFE YOU'VE HEARD YOUR FRIENDS & COWORKERS TALK ABOUTBad Owl puts an adult spin on your childhood fantasies and really brings your adolescent dreams of studying at Hogwarts to life. They're not too over the top with their theme though. Some flying letters up above & Platform 9 & 6/8* off to your right welcome you to the wizarding world and if you're up for it the barista's will happily make you a butterbrew latte to complete your stay. I ordered a lavender white mocha that was quite good, but tasted none like lavender and Matthew ordered a London Fog at the recommendation of our barista. The London Fog was a cup of Earl Grey combined with steamed milk. It would've been perfect had it come sweetened, but that was nothing that a tear & a flick of the wrist couldn't fix. If you're not in the mood for coffee or tea (and you have the liberty to do so), Bad Owl also serves beer and wine! On Thursday's, they offer bottles of wine at half price, so grab a cutie & head on over. We may even see each other there!",real

Amazing food!  The spring rolls and the panang curry were delicious.  Very nice service.  Will definitely go back.  More simple decore - not fancy but the food more than makes up for it!  Recommended.,real
"Delicious! Definitely recommend!! There are so many options for traditional meals in a fresh sashimi every time. I live on the other side of town, but I don't think make it happened to still get anything you can really think of. The lunch specials are incredible.

"absolutely love this place.  the food is excellent, the patio has a great ambience, and it's byob!  for appetizers, i'd recommend the lamb crepes, spinach and asigo dip, and glazed meatballs.  for entrees, i've had the strip steak with gorgonzola and the pork chop with baked polenta.  both were cooked to perfection and soooo yummy.  i've heard great things about trout and eggplant entrees as well.  another bonus -- one time i was there, they brought out complimentary appetizers that they were thinking about adding to the menu (they change/add things to their menu every so often)...which were also amazing!!definitely recommend reservations, as the place is small.",real
This restaurant is amazing! I love the gluten free chicken and waffles! And their Sandwiches are excellent!,fake

"Great tacos Especially Church. Been here now a few times and the food is always great. Both the sushi rolls are good, burgers are great too. My only suggestion is there is plenty to satisfy out of the place. Took a group of us and found out that I can substitute a couple of the doughnuts in there, it was so good and so is the customer service. Excellent service and awesome food! This is why I made oreer as others think its King's burger shop.  Great job!",fake

"Badass breakfast for reasonable price. We are from Chicago where breakfast rules and many places like this exist. This is the only true ""Greek dinner"" in the area. If you want a solid breakfast for a very reasonable deal...go here. Get the Hellenic omelette with smoked sausage. I will refund your money if you don't think it is the best breakfast food you have had in NC.  I have had lunch and dinner here as well a couple times and it will not disappoint.If you are looking for some pretentious Charlotte gastropub...this is not the best place, but if you want dam good food for people who know what their are doing, GO HERE.",real
"Bar food with an elevated twist, and done well. Atmosphere is typical sports bar with top notch service (bravo zulu to Missy behind the bar). I had the burger sliders with fries and jalapeno poppers, both excellent. Everything was noticeably made fresh, no premade, frozen shortcuts here. The sliders were served with marinated onions and peppers (yum) and the jalapeno poppers, which are truly the best I've ever had,  were made with fresh jalapenos, chipotle cream cheese, bacon, and a combo sauce drizzle that was simply delicious plus a scoop of fresh guacamole. Unequivocally recommended.",real
"The owner was kind enough to offer a certificate to fix the rice being left out after finding my review on Yelp. She was very kind about the everything, and I really appreciate her checking reviews.",real
Went to Sushi Kaya on Christmas Day with friends...all locals.  Seated at good table after short wait. Prompt and efficient service by helpful and knowledgeable waiter. Excellent food that came out quickly with good presentation. Although they were very busy there was no pressure to finish. Had a great time in a cozy environment. Have tried other all-you-can-eat sushi places but Sushi Kaya is the best.,real
"Popped in to give this place a try as I've heard nothing but good things about their chicken. And the raves are correct. This is really good chicken. A meaty chicken breast that was moist with a very crispy batter that wasn't so thick that it overwhelmed the chicken.I got a two piece dinner, which came with a dinner roll, a small tub of cole slaw, some tater tots, some hushpuppies and the previously mentioned chicken - one wing and one breast. The tots were excellent. Not too greasy at all, but I was glad to have the one packet of ketchup for dipping.This was a serious ""fried"" plate. If they could fry the cold slaw and the dinner roll, I'll bet they would have done so.Note: This place is TAKE OUT ONLY. There is no dining area that I could see.",real
"This is a great addition to Charlotte. I go at least once a week. The staff is very friendly. The food is awesome and the ambience is so relaxing and it costs a little bit away from the strip, we ordered the bean and cheese burro, and gyro.  And the pork bun with the vegetarian options were out of this world delicious. The maple bacon wrap was very good, and the portions were so big, so were the meats were delicious. The servers were so nice and helpful. Definitely coming back.",fake

They always have good dessert for kids and the staff are welcoming and personable.",fake

My wife and I tried this place after a good night out and after reading the rivers run into the food! The salsa bar is amazing and are pretty tasty.,fake
Came here with my Daughter for an evening snack. We were Greeted as we walked in and seated right away.  I think our Waitress was named Brittany.  She was very friendly and always smiling.  She was very attentive even though she looked like she was by herself and busy.  Over all the food was good.  Took about 15 min for our food.  This is by far our best experience at a Denny in this area. Good job Brittany and others we enjoyed our meal.,real
Omar is an amazing server. Love this place! Weekends are very crowded for dinner so expect a wait time.,real
"Went this past weekend for the Stone Domination event.  I don't know why I didn't make it out here sooner.  I went on Friday and came back on Saturday for more.  It is a bit out of the way, but worth it.  The prices seem pretty standard for craft beers, my tab was about $15 for 2 served in goblets.  Other places in town have a large selection of beers, but usually not on tap, other than Yard House and that does not have the small-bar feeling that I prefer.  I was surprised by how nice the place is on the inside, clean and well-lit, not what I was expecting given the address.  They serve food, which is your standard bar far - the pizza tasted like microwave pizza, but wasn't terrible.  The people there seem friendly, and it is not too hard to get a bartender's attention, even when it was packed on Friday night.  Biggest complaint would be lack of parking when it gets crowded.",real
This was the best bagel we've ever had! We will be back for sure!,fake

Best dinner in Vegas!  Six friends enjoyed dinner together at STRIPSTEAK.  The fries served with truffle sauce are to die for.  We each had an entree and shared sides .... loved the crab cake appetizer.  The scalloped potatoes are divine.  My tuna filet was the best I've ever had.  The service was excellent - we were very well cared for during our dinner.  Hands down the best meal in Vegas.,real
"Always an awesome go to for a quality meal when you're in a relative hurry. My staple is the Italian, but I used to work at a Firehouse when I was in college and can vouch that everything on the menu is great. Meats are fresh sliced every day and made to order while you wait.This location is right around the corner from my new office, which will be dangerous for my wallet, but I had a great experience. Multiple employees came and asked how everything was, if I needed anything, and also offered to fill up my drink during my short visit. Great food and great service!",real

"You must try the new Chorizo-Beef Patty!!  There are rarely new flavors in the Scottsdale culinary world but today, with the discovery of the Chorizo-Beef  patty at Rehab Burger, I can honestly tell you that your taste buds are in for a brave and fantastic treat!When I was a kid, my grandmother would wake me up with the smell of chorizo and eggs, frijoles and homemade tortillas.  Mama did not call for me, her food did.  The aroma and crackle of fresh chorizo and eggs beckoned me to the kitchen where I would enjoy the spicy flavors of her homeland. Today, with the style and flare that only Rehab Burger can muster, a new chorizo con beef patty replicates the taste that heretofore  only could be found in my grandmothers East Los Angeles kitchen.You can order any of the burgers with the Chorizo-Beef patty, but I chose the Pablamo Burger.  Wow!!  Ken prepared my burger medium, and it arrived just as it should, with just the slightest pink in the middle. Served with an egg on top, bacon, cheese, a sweet Pablamo pepper, and sauce... the flavors were amazing!!  So many different tastes burst into my mouth, and the spicyness of the chorizo arrives late, almost as an after-taste... so subtle but unmistakable.  Normally I can't finish one of Rehabs generous plates, but this flavor was so inviting, I kept picking up that burger, bite after bite until it disappeared.Want a burger you can truly call unique and special?  You must try the Chorizo and Beef Patty now! My Ma Ma is gone, but the special taste she produced each morning in her East Los Angeles kitchen lives on! Thank you Rehab Burger for the flavor and memories I thought were long lost!",real
Katie the server and Sheri are so fun! The food was great as always but they make the experience top notch!!! I will always ask for one of these 2 when I come in.,real

"Uh, I can hardly speak!  Eating here was on my bucket list and I don't want to take it off!  The food was unbelievable, the service was excellent and the choices were many.  Each station offered a huge variety of dishes to try. I loved that they were in small portions and cleverly displayed.  One of the cutest was tiny fry baskets with chicken wings.  I think my favorite dish was the lamb polenta.  I went back 3x for more!  We ate leisurely and were never rushed.  Our drinks were refilled and plates cleared often.  And the desserts -- a moment of silence!  Well worth putting on YOUR bucket list -- you won't be disappointed.",real

You can put your egg drop soup in the fridge and unlike other places around here, you will not find a cup of oil the next day...still soup! We have ordered several combinations, all have been good. No problem if you order sauce on the side. Egg rolls, delish! Give them a try. The delivery is fast and super nice.",real

The rolls are huge, and the service is excellent and atmosphere is great!",fake
"One of the classic, delicious Northtown staples that is a stop you must make if you find yourself in this part of town for whatever reason... The kitchen doesn't stop putting out killer wings, really good hamburgers and even some quick Mexican specialties, appreciate the love.. This is a unique spot because it looks sketchy from the outside and inside. But I can appreciate the realness of being able to walk over to the fridge, buy a tall can to drink while you wait for your food and then walk out, no frills or questions - just grub-sesh-status hitters that anyone would enjoy. I like the location, it is close to the college and if you are brave enough to venture there late-night, keep your head on a swivel. But it makes the reward of the great food that much better.  Much love for this locals only spot.",real
Best Italian food in Montreal!  Been ordering here at least 10 times and every single time I've been there that I received from a great vibe and delicious food!  The burgers were terrific.

This is the only way we do sushi...why limit yourself to a la carte when you can unlock the entire menu for $25.95 (dinner 3pm-2am) or $20.95 (lunch 11:30-3pm)Get a carafe of GRAPEFRUIT INFUSED SAKE to share, you might even want 2. Refreshing, cold with citrus accents and the perfect way to start your night or compliment your sushi.Sushi: our friend said it best when describing the freshness...""I know it's fresh when you can't tell the kind of fish, it just melts in your mouth."" That is how good Jjanga's sushi is.FAVORITES: Something Special: calamari tempura, crab wrapped in cucumber topped with eel sauce. Light and doesn't fill you up with rice.Ask for RAYU sauce...sesame, chili infused oil...dip everything in it...especially the Garlic Tuna. You're welcome.The Cheese Croquettes are a must try. Crispy warm fried cheese topped with a creamy sauce. Don't knock it til you try it...it surprised us.Something Wrong 69: A roll where one side starts with salmon and ends on tuna with shrimp tempura on both ends.Did I mention the RAYU sauce? Love that stuff.Oysters: fresh and perfect for shooting. (Limit one per AYCE guest)Screaming Orgasm: delicious but needed more sauce. (Limit one per AYCE guest)Bulgogi : this is the only sushi place that I know who has sizzling Bulgogi on a fajita plate...awesome!To finish your meal, you have to leave room for the Chocolate Malted Crunch Ice Cream. They freakin have Thrifty's ice cream for dessert!This is now our sushi place. I'd appreciate it if you didn't come here on Saturday nights :)",real
"This sucks! I can't believe that Frashers closed. As I said before... It was my St. Louis sanctuary in the valley. I hope the reopen somewhere else in the future. Gilbert maybe? At least for pizza, toasted ravioli and gooey butter cake. This really blows as I was really looking forward to my annual Bday dinner at Frashers.",real

Actually love it - most amazing food I have ever put in my mouth - I have been for lunch and for the taster menu - although the taster menu is so fantasic I cannot even describe it the lunch is really good and extremely good value for money - love it!,real
I ate their Gute Burger and my wife ate compliments to the chef's selections.,fake
"Delicious! We talked in at around 11am....Best ahi place in Vegas! Not so much but the place is awesome. I wish I could go here for happy hour. Very modest and super greasy shows on cuisine, but the food is on point and quick. Also the service was a little slow but it was worth it.",fake

"I always enjoy my time at Lot 17. You can just hang out and grab a beer or enjoy some food in the back. The food is amazing. I especially enjoy the Mediterranean Seafood Salad. It is a MUST ORDER. The sweet potato fries are a great compliment to any of the burgers, wraps, or sandwiches. Go to Lot 17, you will not regret it.",real
Best pizza in Cleveland. One of my favorite spots in Scottsdale! And their complimentary wasabi or the breakfast sandwich with mixed steak. Both were delicious.,fake
"Who doesn't love Thai food that's open till 5 am in Vegas? Sometimes live music. They actually make the food spicy. I usually order papaya salad, basil, and cashew chicken. Quite tasty. Service is usually solid and quick. Good atmosphere. Wish they'd build one in Henderson. Probably my fav Thai spot in Vegas.",real
Great people good service and the food is fantastic.  The staff was very friendly as well!,fake
"Im Osten der Stadt findet man das Aspendos in einem recht unscheinbaren Altbau. Hinter der Tür dann die große Überraschung. Moderne Boden, stilgerechte Einrichtung, sehr ordentlich.Man wird direkt am Eingang begrüßt und zum Tisch geführt - Reservierung lohnt sich!!Wir haben uns mehrere Vorspeisen bestellt und als Hauptgang sowohl Adana Kebap als auch die gemischte Grillplatte gewählt. Die Qualität der Speisen war durchweg gut. Genau so muss türkische Küche sein... Wer frischen Fisch möchte, darf mit dem Kellner zur eigenen Fischtheke und wird dort beraten.Wir haben eine Flasche Prosecco zum Essen bestellt - Auch dabei hat man gesehen, dass das Service-Personal sehr gut geschult ist. Der Service war durch und durch gut - fast schon alte Schule. So wie man es in einer ordentlichen ReFa-Ausbildung lernen sollte. Bei mir immer ganz wichtig: Die Waschräume - Sehr sauber und ordentlich. Wie auch der Rest des Restaurants moderner als erwartet. Zahlungsmöglichkeiten: Neben Bargeld werden auch EC-Karte und sämtliche Kreditkarten akzeptiert. Das Preisleistungsverhältnis ist auch in Ordnung. Hatten zu viert eine Gesamtrechnung von rund 140,- (inkl. Fl. Prosecco, Vorspeisen + Hauptgänge und Getränke). Da gibt man auch gerne Hutes Tip!Parken: Kein eigenen Parkplatz, dafür aber mehrere Möglichkeiten an der Straße oder in den angrenzenden Wohngebieten. ÖV:Sowohl die U-Haltestellen Stockach, als auch Neckartor sind unweit entfernt.",real
"Pai is a truly authentic Thai place I always like to go to. The vibe is cool and the food tastes great. It's conveniently located in downtown Toronto close to all the major attractions. The service is reasonably fast and attentive given how big this place is.I honestly can't say anything negative about it and I'm a pretty picky guy. I just like 'em :)Check 'em out if you're into Thai food and form your own opinion. IMO, Thai food is one of the best in the world along with Japanese, South American and Indian, as long as it's authentic, 'cause there are PLENTY of crappy ethnic restaurants in Toronto.",real
"The chicken souvlaki on a bun at Square Boy is the best deal on the Danforth. I prefer it on the bun over the pita. The buns have always been soft and fresh. The helping of chicken souvlaki is a good size and has never been dry. Also they put tzatziki and a lemon sauce on it, so it is definitely not a dry sandwich.You don't have to wait to taste the Danforth for 5 dollars during the crowds of taste the Danforth. Just get yourself a chicken souvlaki on a bun for 5 bucks anyday at square boy.",real
"This is definitely a supper club staple for Wisconsin. (This review is for the Friday Fish Fry.)If you haven't been before it can seem a little confusing and crowded. Calm down. Nudge your way in and order a drink from the bartender that never forgets. Rail drinks are about $3.50 a piece ($3.75 for an old fashioned) ridiculously reasonable. They also have a surprisingly good selection of beer and wine. (If you need menus ask while ordering your drink.) Find a waitress and place your order. Find a place to kick it for at least the next hour - that sometimes means hovering if you are looking for a place to sit. When your table is ready your waitress will seat you. Salads, relish, and bread will all be waiting. I love the classic aspect of a relish tray. The dressings have that old style taste to them so keep that in mind when ordering (a la not Kraft.) Almost as soon as you can finish your salad a very hot portion of fish will brought to you. My dining partner got the baby pike with a baked potato and I had the cod with French fries - we shared everything. The pike was super delicious, a mild fish taste with a very light breading. The cod was flakey and coated and fried up marvelously - a perfect brown. The baked potato was absolutely huge and came with a solid helping of sour cream. The French fries are flat cut and fried up nice and golden. Far better than your typical restaurant fries - they could have used a little more salt for my taste but that's why there is a shaker on the table. At the end of the meal you also get a sweet treat. The service is spectacular at every end of the operation. From the bartenders, waitresses, to bus boys, everyone is friendly and willing to get you what you need. I definitely recommend this place for when you have the time to just sit back with some cocktails and a fish fry - our meal took about 2 1/2 hours all together - so expect at least that on a Friday night!",real
I've been to the world for 7 days and this passion is incredible.My chicken is ONO style. They can be long for a thing.,fake
"I have loved Casanova's ever since trying it over two years ago. My husband and I had just moved into the neighborhood and decided to try it. We have not regretted that decision. The moment we walked in, Tony greeted us and asked for our names.  He has remembered us ever since. I love their garlic knots and their pizza is fabulous. If I am not in the mood for pizza, I usually get a calzone with ham and pineapple but all of their dishes are delicious. My husband loves the lasagna and baked ziti. I recently had our first child and Casanova's was one of the places I craved (especially their garlic knots). I have never had anything I did not like at Casanova's. We recently moved to Apache Junction and miss being able to pick up Casanova's and take it home. We still try to make it to see Tony and the gang though. If you have not tried Casanova's yet, you are missing out.",real
"Kevin is the best bartender in Cleveland.  I'm serious! He created a signature drink for my wedding reception almost a year ago... Then when I stopped into Toast and asked for the ""bartenders choice"" drink, I was rewarded with a wonderful creation.  He has a great memory and a great sense of flavor combinations.Finally, while I was pregnant he made a great ginger virgin cocktail.",real

I purchased a Groupon deal while visiting Vegas. Located directly across from the Fountains of Bellagio so you can imagine the view especially at night if you opt to sit outside. It's on The Strip so there's a lot of foot traffic. The atmosphere was nice & the food was great!,real
Nothing much fun with me for a lot to come to burritos to try it. Would recommend anybody to go. Unfortunately the building is mediocre as well. Not a big fan of sauces and so you can taste delicious.,fake
"Love this place. The food, the games, the atmosphere, it's all wonderful. And the price isn't too bad. I especially love their $16.99 dinner and games deal and their half price game Wednesdays.",real
Amazing Ramen! Would definitely recommend the sweet potato fries. Perfectly cooked and live entertainment!,fake
"Started off with the kanom jeeb I can describe it best like a crab cake egg roll. Next the Tom kai with chicken was similar to Panang curry in soup form with lemongrass and cilantro flavors.  Very delicious. One of us got drunken noodles.  It was sweet and spicy ""it was good.""   I had the Panang chicken and I'm pretty certain that if I was on death row I would order this as a last meal.  Large extra rice.   For dessert we tried ordering the sticky rice with mangoes and they were out.   Not ""cool."" So we ordered the flaming ice cream its like tempura fried ice cream with fire and rum.  It was probably the least tasty item of the night.",real
Delicious food and quick service. I've been eating heak since we return to this location. There food is tasty and delicious. I definitely recommend this place!,fake
"I'm pretty obsessive about my food.  I cook most of my meals myself.  Every so often, a special restaurant comes along that captures my interest.  TownHall is my current fascination.  Verging on an addiction.  There is something special about this place.  The extremely diverse clientele; The awesome servers;  The overall environment;   The awesome location in the heart of Ohio City;   The rock solid delivery of good food at reasonable prices, every time.I work in Downtown Cleveland and start lobbying with my co-workers first thing in the morning about where we should do lunch. For the past several weeks, TownHall has been my choice.This is difficult for me, as I'm mostly vegetarian.  I went out on a limb one day and tried the Kobe Burger at TownHall. There is something so special and so delicious about this burger.  This is a burger I dream about.  A burger  I constantly think about.  A burger I can't get over.  I've probably had 25 of them over the past several weeks, and each one is better than the last...I've been through a lot of single food fascinations over the years, but this fascination and enjoyment of the TownHall Kobe Burger has been one of the best ever...TownHall.  To me, you are the king of Cleveland restaurants right now.  I know empires come and go, but for now, this place is THE SHIT.  Whomever envisioned and created this place and then put together the team that makes this place tick is a true culinary master and artist.",real
"Food was great, service was quick and friendly.  We will be back here again when in vegas.",fake
I like how they deliver. The chef recommended the cup cake with my husband had the spice square. Tried the 55 carbonara pasta with chipotle burger and it's so good! Definitely a place to check out.,fake

I either get the Bird omelet, or the BC Sandwich, both delicious. If I could make one suggestion, maybe the management will read this ;), please start offering Individual French press coffee, would make this a 6 star place!! See you next Saturday BClub!",real

My significant other complains that everything could use just a little more seasoning, but I'm always happy with it.I love love love the falafel.  I love it in wraps, on pizzas, and in salads.  The appetizers are great too!  Foole M Damas is AMAZING (Puree of fava beans, garlic, extra virgin olive oil and lemon topped with diced tomatoes and parsley. Pita on the side) You must try it.  The iced tea is amazing as well and they have a nice little beer menu if you prefer some alcohol.The atmosphere is relaxed and casual and the servers are always very attentive.",real
"Great view. Try to pork belly and duck, love the food. Service is always amazing. Sarah is always ready to help with a great wine, knows her stuff. We again this week for another amazing dinner!",real
"We ordered the fried chicken Benedict with eggs over easy as opposed to scrambled. We split the meal between two people and barely finished it!!! Reasonably priced for the portions. I was a bit hesitant about the dish as it included chipotle cream, fresh spinach and tomatoes. But it was perfect!!! A must try. We had about a twenty minute wait to be seated at 11am, not bad, worth it",real
I think it is better than both Hot and Juicy and Boiling Crab. They have desserts!Ice Cream just makes scenes after you have spicy food.They also have plates and forks!!!!,real
"Great food, cool spot in the middle of a pool tables. Real Mexican food at a reasonable price.",fake
"I pulled over into this Waffle House to get out of the rain and to let some of this weekday 5 o'clock traffic die down. The entire staff was wonderful. The two waitresses that were working that night were down to earth, friendly, and extremely funny. Even if the meal wasn't good they would have made the trip inside worth it, but I had no complaints for my Texas Bacon Patty Melt w/hash browns and added onions (I literally gained two pounds while I was writing this...I can only imagine how much I gained while I actual ate this). The cook talked to my bf about sports and the other customers even got in on the conversation and it ended up that the entire place was laughing. I felt like they were part of my extended family and will definitely be back, if not for the food then for the hospitality :)",real
"My kids and I love this place, its our go to spot on the weekends when I don't want to cook.  The Sonoran hot dogs or delicious and the service is warm and welcoming.  The buns alone are worth the drive, they are soft, light and fluffy.  They compliment the Sonoran dog perfectly. There are soft  drinks and chips and you can get what you want on your Sonoran dog, I like mine with everything!",real
"The grand opening of Tail & Fin was everything I thought it would be... and more! Upon parking easily right out front, we walked in and immediately jumped on line (it was understandably busy) The restaurant is in a small section of the strip mall and neighbors Teriyaki Madness, Subway, and a pizza place.It has minimal modern decor that caters to us ridiculous social media addicts (Photo op wall, and a snapchat geo tag).There's only about 8 tables, if that. So, I expect it to always be full. We opted to take our food to-go, instead of waiting for a seat to open. The food is to die for. My husband and I got two different burritos. We semi customized both. We ordered The Crabby Bastard- soft shell crab, surimi crab, cucumber, tomato, furikake, avocado, pomegranate, unagi sauce. We subbed the  pomegranate for spicy tuna and cilantro.Also, The Omega- salmon, surimi crab, romaine, tomato, avocado, red onion, ponzu, honey sesame aioli. I added mango, raw jalapeño & chili garlic aioli. I highly recommend adding mango, it adds a nice sweetness. We were in and out in 10 minutes, on the grand opening day, including our wait time on line. Impressive! The staff was organized, happy and on point! I anticipate eating here at least once a week! Happy Yelping!",real
What a gem of a place. They also offered an extreme menu and some drinks and beers. Our server was friendly and attentive. She was fast and friendly. We enjoyed dining in and check out this place. We definitely would go back again!,fake
This place is my favorite way to eat in Las Vegas we have to go back (Moroccan for the first time and the food was amazing! I will definitely go back again to get a drink and enjoy the group of people.,fake
"My husband and I went here for restaurant week.  This restaurant was amazing.  I am a picky eater and send back food regularly, making my husband want to hide under the table.  This place was AMAZING.  You will not find this food anywhere. Unique recipes, inspired and delicious. My appetizer was a scallop with pickeled jalapeno with thinly sliced orange.  The spicey jalapeño mixed with the tangy orange was a delicious heat coupled with the cool orange was just a delicious flavor profile. The presentation of every dish was so pretty too!  I had the crispy duck for the main course, a nice size portion of crispy and juicy duck with this amazing cherry chipotle sauce! The roasted creamy parsnips was coated in a crusted breading that was just happiness on my tastebuds.  For dessert I had the chipotle chili brownie with avocado ice cream.  The chili brownie was crisper on the outside and soft with a nice chewy inside. Avocado ice cream sounded weird, but surprisingly it was pleasantly yummy! The place has a nice casual unique ambiance, friendly staff. Hands down my new favorite restaurant.  They switch up their menu seasonally. Seriously try this place. The food is YUMMY!!!!!! If I could pick more than five stars I would.",real
Super yummy! My family and I have eaten here for a nice date since I am part it was delish!,fake
"Not only is this truly the best buffet in Las Vegas, but they continually improve and innovate to keep them at the top of the highly competitive buffet industry in Las Vegas. I've come often to this buffet, and this buffet is notorious for their long lines and ridiculous wait times...and people do it! Thankfully, I have a line pass that allows me to bypass the stressful, Disney-esque line for the general public.On our most recent visit, I came with a friend who has a severe egg allergy. As soon as our waitress was informed, she got one of the managers to come over. The manager let us know he will get a chef to come over and assist immediately. In mere minutes, Chef Ryan appeared. Chef Ryan offered two options: 1) he can take my friend through the endless buffet options and steer her away from anything with eggs, or 2) make her something from scratch. My friend chose option 2, and Chef Ryan did not disappoint!Chef Ryan made a gigantic bone-in rib eye steak fit for at least two people! Talk about generous! I realize this is an expensive buffet, but that rib eye was certainly worth more than the buffet!Also, my biggest complaint with Bacchanal has always been their less than impressive desserts. Well, their new pastry chef, Emma (I think that's her name), is absolutely incredible! The desserts have transformed from an afterthought to highlight! The salted caramel cupcake is so good! I usually take several desserts and just take bites...this time, I ate all of it!Lastly, I have to really recognize GM Steven Kuo and his team. The management team really works to keep the image of the buffet in top form at all times...even during peak time! Through all of that chaos, they still take the time to talk to the customers to make sure they are having a wonderful experience. Truly impressive operations, amazing and inventive food, and world-class service! Can't ask for anything more!",real
This is what Mexican fast food should be. Good food for a good price. This beats Roberto's tacos hands down. The restaurant setup makes me think of Wendy's but the food makes me think actual Mexican restaurant. I'm very pleased with my visit here. I'll be back!,real
"Bumping this up to 5 stars. As I have stated before, they have really good appetizers... the wings and the mozzarella sticks are my favorite. For Dinner there is a really good 4 cheese mac and cheese with honey pepper tenders... get them! They are amazing! Both the mac n cheese which has some bacon in it, and the chicken tenders (OMG so good) are great choices. If you're thinking you want a less caloric meal, go for the lemon Parmesan shrimp on the 550 or less menu. It is really good, and I always get a side of the stuffed mushroom for less than $2 extra. So good. Service is usually always great, and I haven't had a meal I didn't like here.",real
This is a hidden gem in Toronto and this place is family owned. Service was excellent  and our waiter Kevin was awesome and made the experience even better! I will come back again!!!! Will save the story with the coolest old school chain restaurant I have been.,fake

"A turkey burger... yes... turkey burger... was the best burger I have eaten in Vegas before. And that's after hitting-up a whole lot of burger places by now.We tried the iteration of this restaurant prior to LVB once while staying at Mirage, and didn't like it too much. But, we were hungry, and had been on quite the mid-day Fat Tuesday-daiquiri stroll up the strip, so why not try again?It did not disappoint.  Great ingredients, good food prices, lots of unique options; but just okay cocktails (although expensive for what you're getting, even for Vegas standards).Located across from Rumbar near the side strip entrance to Mirage, this is a must-visit if you want a good burger near the Mirage.",real
The best sandwich I've ever had.  I had the shrimp and it was awesome.  Very affordable and good quality.,fake

If you want a traditional German meal. Look no further.Went here at short notice and loved every minute! Had the giant pork leg with bread dumpling and white cabbage. Simply the best I've ever eaten.It was a huge meal but I did my best.Our party of three had a variety of meals and they were all good. The cheese noodles seemed a bit of an acquired taste but I liked them.The staff were good even though didn't speak much English. We never felt out of place our unwelcome.Highly recommended.,real

"What sold us on Spice of Life for our wedding was their local, sustainable focus and presentation. They were great to work with throughout our planning process, the food was fantastic, and presentation was like nothing you've ever seen before (they give new meaning to ""buffet"").

They were a pleasure and while we don't plan on having another wedding, we'll definitely be visiting the restaurant!",real

I've ordered from this place for a long time. Wish they were open later afternoon on Monday nights.,fake
"Im with the rest of the folks on here, in the fact that I really can't say enough good things about this place. It has a modern but rustic atmosphere, that just flows. I guess if I had to complain about anything it would be that the hostess dress was so short I thought it would just roll up at any second and give the restaurant a show. Very unclassy and not appropriate attire. But, now to the good stuff! Get the bacon board. Its literally a wooden block with different flavors of bacon. Don't even think about it.Just order it.The moonshine will also give your body an unpleasant kick in the face, but its good! The martinis were also fantastic. Great happy hour pricing and a really neat place overall. Would definitely stop by again next time we're in Phoenix.",real
"Lobbys has gotten even better since my first visit 2 years ago. They now have ice cream shakes to wash down their awesome food.  Woohoo! I have come here many times since that first visit and always enjoy the cheeseburgers.Today I tried the Italian Beef sandwich. Overflowing with tender, tasty beef. You can add sweet or hot peppers. I got the au jus on the side for dipping (keeps the hard roll from getting soggy). Cost was $6 for the sandwich and $3 for the chocolate shake. Still freakishly clean for a burger place and parking is close to the door. The employees were friendly. BONUS POINTS: They open at 10am! Great local business that beats the chains hands down.The only improvement I can think of would be the addition of kid's sized portions. When I bring my grandkids I end up having to split the order. That can get kind of messy. Also, many seniors don't have a big enough appetite for the hearty portions served here and could benefit from a smaller portion as well.",real

(It's in a strip and I admit that I just assumed it was like every other sports bar because of that.) But a friend was told their food is great, so we went.Even though it's location is sort of obvious, I'd call it a hidden gem. It's NOT like your average sports bar - there's a seated restaurant on the other side of the bar and you cannot hear the bar at all.

I fell in love with the place The staff is so friendly, the cupcakes were divine (yes I said divine, nothing bad to say at all) the place is was clean and very urbanesque (I just made up a new word)the coffee was really good. If they were not clear in Gilbert I'd go there often. They are next to Joe's which the lines are insane, but the hidden gem is The Coffee Shop.",real
"Great atmosphere, great food, great owner. I eat here every weekend to come eat everything here is outstanding.",fake
Food was great! Service was excellent and prompt. And the service was pleasant.  The menu had a band playing my once a week and found the food was amazing from the margaritas to the amazing service.  Modern and dark feel. I would recommend this place for a fun date night for dinner!,fake
Best sushi I've ever had! Alaska sushi sucks compared to this place. Great service & bomb ass sushi. My best friend brought me here for all you can eat sushi. The food came out faster then any place I've ever been too. Thank you,real
I am a big fan of their hummus and garlic noodles. The best I've had in Toronto. Highly recommend.,fake
Great little place! The house salad bar is a must try!!! Very clean and service is great! Fast service!,fake
Really great everything! Always consistently cheaper than find some good sushi.  Great service and staff.  Food was amazing and all the staff are so nice.,fake
This place is gorgeous... I love the chicken glaze and the papaya salad. The wait staff is real inviting! I will be back next time I come to Vegas!,fake
One of the best meals I have had in vegas everything we ordered was very flavorful. From the outside doesn't look like much but nice ambience overall. This place is about to get very popular,real
I love this place! The sushi is so fresh every time! My favorite sushi in Las Vegas  soto is an amazing sushi chef. Come check it out!!!,real
"I was recently in Toronto and stopped by this place.  I was skeptical at first but don't let the appearance fool you.  Usually the places I go to back in the states are dirty and the people are rude.  This place is clean.  They have a good selection and the prices are great!  The people here are friendly, helpful, and courteous.  What more do you want!",real
Really cool atmosphere and the food is also wonderful. Always has the best ambiance and look of the place. Parking is pricy but I checked in on a customer for wine we will be back soon.,fake
Nekter is a must! So much better than Jamba Juice or any other smoothie place. And the acai bowls are so good! Everything is fresh and very Tasty. My new favorite!,real
"One of the best burgers in the area. The fresh spring rolls are delicious.  I always get the chicken shawarma and the Mac and cheese burger, they were amazing! I cant wait to come back and try dining again.",fake
"Ah! I reviewed the Food Lab on the main SAT listing! Which is ok because it gives me a chance to write more about how much I love this place! A lot of the reviews here describe what happens during a huge event, and that's legitimate, but absolutely not reflective of a regular evening at this lovely spot. At the top floor of the Societe des Arts Technologique in a wide open space with a wide open kitchen and wide open terrasse, this is a space where you can eat fresh new menu items each month on a theme, and you can see all the beautiful people making and serving beautiful things. The head chef here is a woman, and a tough and wildly cool one at that, and she makes food that is deceptively simple and super super delicious. Come with a group and try everything. They work with private importers for wine lists tailored to each menu.I don't want to describe the many wonderful things I have eaten here because the menu is sure to be different, but suffice to say, this is one of my favourite romantic drink and bite places in the summer, and sparkly spots to feel outside of time at any time of year.",real
I am very pleased with our choices and one of everything!  Very moist version of the Black Bear diner.,fake
"Service was good, server was attentive and friendly. She took care of all will make you a couple of new boss!!! Great for large party of 15. Brunch menu is great too. The prices are a treat to take home and try different things. Friendly staff. Fun atmosphere. And so friendly! It's always a nice atmosphere to go and watch the casino house. The service is awesome! My daughter ate pizza and one of the last time there this morning (the only thing that could make it down or day have been 2 to 3 some which is freaking awesome.",fake
"This place is amazing. I wooked a lot of their entrees and I always get the tuna sandwich. With crispy beef, salad, chicken and shrimp, brisket and kloss oil are also very good. Carlo beans is our favorite Cajun food in the city!",fake
Great food and great service! Definitely going to go back.,fake
Great atmosphere and food is always delicious!  This location is great for date night.  Always a great time!,fake
I'm not entirely sure why this place is categorized as Italian. If you are thinking of eating here do not hesitate. This is the Mecca of progressive cuisine. I ate at the bar and felt like I was sitting in a living room in an ultra cool speakeasy. Hand crafted cocktails started the evening perfectly. This is a dining experience. Choose wisely. The menu changes with the seasons. I'm not going to go on about what I ate. A Great restaurant is not about the individual dishes. It's about how it all weaves together like a fine fabric to create an incredible dining experience. Nora Gray is that experience. Don't hesitate.,real

"This is one of the Best restaurants I have ever been to. If you like Thai food, or want to try it out. This place serves real Thai, cooked well and great service. And you get to see some lovely Thai ladies serving your table. Did I mention I think Thai women are special. Well it doesn't matter, except to me.",real
"I have been here 5 times. Not sure why people rate it less than 4 stars. Either way they have vegan, vegetarian, and normal menus. Very flavorful. The quinoa pancakes are a great healthy choice to breakfast.  Corn chowder is very good. My wife gets the vegan burger and says it's the best tasting vegan burger she has had. I love fresh healthy ingredients and this place has exactly that.",real
First off the drinks we're one of the best I've ever had! Brussel sprit nachos were AMAZING! Poke and pineapple pork bowl were delicious as well! Waitress was very helpful with the menu!  Cool and trendy atmosphere! If you are in the area you must go!!!,real

"This Subway is definitely the best Subway that I have ever been too.  The first time you walk through the doors you are a guest.  The next time you are family.   I work closer to another Subway but always walk a few extra minutes to come to Subway  in the Consol Energy Center.  All the employees here are so sweet, kind, and go out of their way to make sure your order is perfect.  The manager Tara is the nicest lady.  Whenever I am having a bad day at work, just her warm welcoming and greeting make me feel better.  She definitely is a great asset to this Subway",real
"Very nice place and wonderful customer service. Delicious fish tacos, everything was delicious and the cashier was a super friendly staff. I'll be back.",fake
"AWESOME, even though we were the only ones there.... hope more people find this gem. Tacos are made fresh to order. You get your base, corn tortilla and protein and then you dress them up how YOU want.   I tried one shrimp and one fish to get a baseline. Both were awesome... but I think the shrimp was the victor.Make sure you get an order of fries so you can enjoy all the sauces. You absolutely must try mixing the cilantro cream with the Chipotle sauce.",real
Unique experience. Super fancy fun place in the bottom floor of the Omni. The bartenders are top notch. The drinks are unique to represent prohibition times and even are made with many local distilled liqueurs on the very same street. The pricing is reasonable and there are many drinks to choose from. Very fun ambiance.,real
I fell in love with this place! The sandwiches are always good and the service is always consistent.  Food is always kind and made the whole diner feel.  Def coming back again!!!,fake
My daughters got to give it a try. Her single and i was very impressed. We'll definitely be coming back! :),fake
"This place is amazing! It is a fantastic place to watch sports.  They have a TV in the bathroom so you won't miss a minute of the action which I Iove. They also have wonderful sushi! Being from Seattle I'm a little bit of a sushi snob but this place fulfilled my lofty expectations! All the food is fresh. Their hot wings were also delicious, and they let you choose any of their recipes if you order them off  of the happy hour menu. The HQ signature recipe  was my favorite.  Great beer selection, and the staff are pleasant and will even stop by for a chat every once in a while. Don't pass up the dessert menu,  words can't describe the apple pie sushi roll. Just try it and be amazed.  Definitely worth a visit (or a few) of you're in the area!",real
"Definitely will be going here if I'm craving Greek food. Most Greek restaurants by me have food that is either salty or not very fresh. So either the meat wasn't really good so they over season, and they order too much vegetables. Luckily this wasn't the case at Greek Bistro.  I ordered a Gyro plate and my husband ordered a Gyro sandwich. So tasty! Impressed with the salad, and the rice was cooked to perfection. We both left waddling out of there.   Finding this place is a little hard and when you do, you end up driving around a bit to find parking. Don't worry it's worth finding. Can't wait to try the rest of their menu in the future.",real
We have eaten at the Oak Barrel several times and it has been consistently amazing.  I think that speaks volumes for a restaurant when you can go  more than once and receive the same exceptional quality food and service.  It is in our top 5 favorite places to eat.  The pulled pork over jalapeno cornbread with onion straws and apple slaw is my absolute fav.  My husband loves the Dr. Pepper pork shank.  Would definitely recommend,real
"Best margaritas I've ever had! They were not syrupy and fake and they were strong! The prices are higher than your typical ""pick a meal 1-50"" but it's evident they use high quality ingredients.  The chicken was so tender and juicy and smokey from the grill, and the jumbo shrimp were HUGE!  Everything was wonderful, I was trying to be healthy so we skipped the chips and salsa but I'm hoping to come back and try them because everyone around us seemed to be inhaling them and they looked delicious! This is definitely elevated Mexican cuisine and we will put this on our list of places to eat at monthly.  I felt like I could eat a real healthy meal here too which most times I feel like crap after going to for Mexican.",real
The food and beverage selection is a little small though. I would recommend this to anyone!  We always pass by this place again and again!,fake
"I really like this pizza joint. At first it seems like any restaurant where you could get just a slice of pizza from but one look at the menu and you will see that this place has everything from calzones to tiramisu. I was thoroughly impressed. The food is top notch and I don't plan on going anywhere else for pizza ever again. Being a Las Vegas native, I love supporting local businesses. I even met the owner the last time I went there with a coworker and he was a genuine guy who cared about his craft and the people who came to his business.",real
Discovered this little gem in my neighborhood. The service is awesome. The staff made me feel so welcomed and seemed to appreciate my patronage. The drinks and food are absolutely delicious and the price point is extremely  reasonable.,real

"HOW IN THE WORLD HAVE I NEVER REVIEWED THIS PLACE? Yes, triple D brought me here but amazing food (and beer) is what keeps me coming back. If you've never been you must get the sampler for two. Gives you a chance to try everything. I am obsessed with all of the schnitzel, red cabbage, sauerkraut and basically everything on the menu. The soup of the day is always a hit... Oh we also love the pretzel with cheese, like I will fight someone over the last piece of that. And of course the sauerkraut cake is like nothing you have ever had. Delish. Take it to go because you're going to be stuffed after your meal. Love the choices of German beers. It's always a treat to come here, what other place could impress a full blooded German girl?",real
Fantastic food and service.  The soup made it a tremendous to give them a better experience.  Everything is super customizable and you can taste the yummies and what do you expect from a perch and lunches which is a total regular style crowd. Fun and speedy and friendly staff.,fake
Excellent service.  Food warm and yummy. New place in our neighborhood next to KFC on Windmill. Clean place. Breakfast and lunch. We will be back.,real
We ate here last week & I was very pleased with how the manager was walking table to table after the people cleaned them to make sure they were all clean. I got the giant burrito with steak that came with beans & rice; so so good. My husband loved his taco salad. The service was awesome. Will definitely go back!!!,real

The best service and food! I highly recommend this place for a fantastic lunch at recent trip.,fake
Definitely the best steak in Montreal! My all time favorite stop in Montreal. Pancakes and baguette are terrific. They also have a great crowd worth a try. Always come here when i come here.,fake
"I totally dig this place. The ambiance, the food, and the bartenders all work for me. Dulia, a bartender, is a total doll. Their margaritas are strong and decently priced. They do have food, but the menu is small. Me and my friend shared two appetizers: the fish tacos and the quesadilla, and an order of onion rings and were happily stuffed and it only cost us $10 each. Once it gets later this place totally fills up and people dance, drink, and have a good time. The sinks being outside of the bathrooms is kind of odd but not really a big deal. Its totally worth checking out if you are on Mill.",real

"Ich kann nur positives über das MGM berichten, empfehlen kann ich die Queen Zimmer, ca. 45 m2 für 2 Personen, echt klasse. Zimmer sind neu und sehr sauber. Das Hotel ist einfach gigantisch und der Poolbereich spitze. Wer Party mag ist hier richtig, klasse Musik und junges Publikum. Frühstück ist etwas teuer mit 25$, da empfehle ich links neben dem Hooters einen Diner, hier gibt's Frühstück mit O-Saft und Kaffee für 7,5$ echt lecker. Um 09:00 Uhr da sein, sonst muss man warten !!Günstiges Bier gibt's auf der Fremont Street 0,4 für 4 $, im MGM Flasche für 7,5$ plus tax und Trinkgeld. WLAN ist kostenlos und fast überall im MGM zu empfangen. Ich werde nächstes Jahr nochmal nach Vegas reisen, natürlich wieder ins MGM.",real
"This is a great place to eat.  I have dinner there once a week, and it's been amazing.  The pink taco kick its as good as it gets.  The taste was very good. The shakes are amazing and the ground beef chunks and especially the ""pizza"" and the BSB are a must try",fake
Stopped in for lunch and found a new favorite!! We ordered from the chips and salsa there and they were still on time and fresh. The garlic naan was fantastic. My new favorite place!,fake
"I can't think of a better way to start your day in Vegas!  Literally the best breakfast/brunch I've ever had.... biscuits and gravy with homemade sausage topped with fried chicken, bacon, and eggs! What?!?  Great service and ambiance as well. Happy Vegas-ing.",real
"This place is awesome! Great Irish ambiance and entertaining live music while you dine and drink. The food was amazing. I had been craving a lamburger, which they happened to have, and it was heaven (with rosemary, goat cheese & curry aïoli). Our waitress Finnouala was from Belfast, and helped make the whole experience more than perfect. My friend's aunt happens to be going to Belfast in a month, and she gave her insider tips on where to go and what to do. We lingered to listen to the band and drink our drinks. You have to check this place out at least once, but I'm sure you'll want to go back as much as I do.",real
"Voici un resto de fruits de mer des plus agréables, à tel point qu'il attire de nombreux VIP dont vous pourrez apercevoir les autographes sur... des coquilles d'huîtres accrochées au mur dans le vestibule!

Les plats sont bien préparés et témoignent d'une certaine recherche en cuisine, ce qui est toujours très agréable.

"Waffles... Why not?My sister introduced me to this wonderful little cafe that serves up waffles in any way imaginable. Waffles cafe is owned by Jeff and Yooni. They are always present and personable, and they get to know their customers.I love the fact that their waffle batter is their own and made on site. They have an all day breakfast special, lunch specials, and even boba drinks.My absolute favorite is the tuna sandwich. Tuna on a waffle in place of bread? Honestly, the idea of it scared me a little, but after one bite, I almost punched myself for not being more willing in the beginning. Their tuna is mixed there and the sauce they drizzle on the tuna really makes it a Waffles Cafe original.Wait time can be a slight problem because they make the waffles upon order, so please do not come here expecting instant food. Your patience will be rewarded.",real
"This place is outstanding! if you're looking for a place that you can come and feel like home, friendly and family oriented you should come here to Adela's! I feel like they really are friendly with the hospitality there and generous. It's great I love this place!The food just keeps getting better. I recommend the manicotti, fettuccini primavera and chicken parmesan.   I will keep coming back!",real
"We went here for lunch on a brief trip through Vegas, and it was spectacular.  The service was excellent and the food was delicious.  I had the Grilled Cuban Burger which was love at first bite, my daughter had the Swordfish sandwich which she truly enjoyed.  The wait staff was attentive but did not hover, they were knowledgeable about the menu and made excellent suggestions.  I am anxious to get back to Vegas and go here for dinner.",real
"The Afton Ridge Chick-Fil-A location is the best fast-food restaurant I've ever visited, hands down.  They consistently deliver an incredible customer experience and have what I could consider to be the most customer-centric team in Concord.  I worked near this location nearly 2 years and visited often, but haven't been in the area in nearly a year.  My visit today proves that nothing has changed... it is the same, consistently incredible, experience I had become accustomed to.  The team is so dedicated to their community, and it shows in everything they do.",real
Lovely spot. The food was pretty amazing. The service was great. I can't wait till my family has been to this place and seriously nothing negative to say.,fake
One of the best breakfast spots in Phoenix!  The food is delicious and the staff is always friendly.,fake
"Absolutely amazing hamburgers. Amazing garlic fries. Amazing shakes, fried zucchini, and onion rings. I can go on, or you can read the other five hundreds reviews on this place, its even been featured on Food Network.  Joe's Farm Grill is a great, original, retro, family-friendly restaurant serving fresh organic quality food.  Beautiful outdoor picnic area type seating surrounded by large mature trees, even an outdoor soda machine and condiment station, which is great since so many of us Arizonans just love eating and being outside!. Surprisingly enough, it is not nearly as crowded as I thought it would be. Its not exactly close to home, but there are a few places I always like to swing by when I am in the area- and best believe this is one of them.",real
One of my top 2 favorite sushi buffet locations in Vegas! Everything is delicious & service is prompt. Wait time can be a bit if busy but so worth the wait.,real
 Love this place! The food is amazing.  Very friendly staff and high quality ingredients.,fake
Delicious food and service! Definitely won't be my last! I highly suggest a restaurant to try if you're in the area.,fake

I really enjoy walking into an establishment and being greeted warmly. And that's exactly how it was here when we walked in for breakfast. Even though it was crazy busy inside the staff all had smiles and were nice and friendly! That makes a huge difference! Now let's get to the food! I only got the 5-cheese Mac n cheese due to not being too hungry but oh my lord was it DIVINE. I consider myself a Mac n cheese connoisseur and this was one of the best I've had yet! The favors were delicious! And you could tell all ingredients were fresh! Score! The wife had the Sustainable Salmon omelet and she enjoyed it. On a scale of one to ten she gave it a 10. She too enjoyed the atmosphere and food. We will definitely be making another stop here in the next few weeks to try some more of the awesome looking menu!,real
I always love eating at Oreganos but this last time I went in was amazing. Denise was very friendly and so bubbly. She recommended menu items that I had not tired. She made my day with her happy mood and helpful service. I wish all servers were like her.,real
"It's early Monday morning and the fiancé and I are still tired yet hungry from the weekends activities. Breakfast naturally comes to mind. The fiancé immediately searches yelp for a few recommendations when he comes across ""Cinammon's"". You mean, Hawaii's own Cinnamons? I couldn't believe it, so without hesitation, off to Cinnamons we go.  We entered the establishment across from Trader Joe's, and it was pleasant with an Aloha vibe. The hostess immediately seated us with a smile and asked if were locals, since I assume there are many out of town visitors. I'm surprised to see it isn't busy, but then again it is Monday and it is back to school (something I don't mind as much).  We are handed the menu as I order their Kona coffee. I notice the menu isn't obnoxiously long with pages of food. I prefer a short menu since I know the back of house usually focuses on flavor and presentation, not to mention timeliness when the menu isn't as extravagant.  How can I choose from all the yummyness? So we decided on:1. Short stack of guava pancakes2. Short stack of pistachio cream pancakes3. Full order of Kalua pig eggs Benedict with tots4. A side of kimchi fried rice. Let's review!!!1. The guava pancakes had a nice presentation with guava sauce slathered and a generous dollop of whip cream to top it off. The pancakes were  moist and fluffy and the guava sauce complimented it nicely with a sweet and tart kick. Delicious! Just make sure to have a glass of milk or coffee near by since the pancakes will definitely choke you with goodness! 2. The pistachio cream pancakes were unique and just as delicious. These were moister than the guava 'cakes since it looks like the pistachio flavor was infused in the actual pancakes and again drizzled over the top with cream and a generous sprinkle of pistachios. WOW!!! These are a party in your mouth, but don't forget to sip on some coffee with each bite to help you swallow!!! 3. A full order of the kalua eggs Benedict is two benedicts instead of 1. I recommend the full order since these are irresistible. The kalua pig itself is super tender and moist (I love that word) and slightly salty. A great combination with eggs and their creamy hollandaise sauce. The eggs were poached perfectly with a nice runny yolk to add additional creaminess to coat your mouth. The side of tots were probably one of my favorites I've had in a while. They were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and mixed with a lovely sauté of peppers and onions. Great compliment to the dish as it adds texture to the soft tenderness of the pork. 4. The kimchi fried rice is a burst of flavor in your mouth. A bit salty and tart from the kimchi is a tasty flavor profile that would probably taste best with sunny side up eggs and a protein of choice. Accompany the rice however you choose, it is delectable regardless! ***extra.... the Kona coffee had a sweet roasted aroma and tasted even better. Smooth finish and served in a to go cup, which I didn't mind since I sipped on it almost all day. It was, however, slightly pricey at almost $5!!!! Cinnamon's is a breakfast joint I'll be revisiting soon, since there are tons of other options I'd love to try. It is a quaint, clean, and friendly environment, prompt service, and an overall comfortable ambiance. Our total came out to about $36 before tip, just about $18 pp, not the cheapest, but definitely affordable if you're looking at it in a quality perspective. We ended up with leftovers, but if you love ""super sized"" meals, you may want to order more dishes. I can't wait to see more Cinnamon's pop up through out the rest of the valley, making it a staple on the 9th island.",real
Stopped in today for the filet with pesto sausage and bacon - not too sweet.  The beer selection is incredible.  The restaurant is also great and so is the food.  The BBQ is delicious as well.  Try the Honey Boby and the Thai tea.  Service is superb!  It was our second time here.  The food was amazing and the service was good.  Be prepared for a line.  It was clean and the customer service was fantastic so we got a cashier was so very attentive and friendly. The food was great. Will definitely make this place a regular spot for me and my co-worker. We will be making this a regular spot!,fake

"The weekend lunch buffet is one of the best I've ever seen.  Huge selection of really tasty Indian food.  The menu also delves into southern Indian cuisine which I've never seen elsewhere.  The servers actually care whether you're happy and do a good job.Like others have mentioned, the atmosphere is a little bizarre but the very diverse crowd usually dining there makes it feel like a 'big city' restaurant.  One of my favorites in Madison.  Did I mention that its cheap?",real
"So nice has it all. Place is clean, and simple!! Great place to eat or lunch and a great attitude for business partners. I've been to the west and while staying in Phoenix and this place is a must. Ask for Magic.",fake
Don't be discouraged but my favorite is the bar (artice beer). I highly recommend the chicken hash. Also tried a mixed meat and enjoyed it all. Will be back again!,fake

"I have a friend who has been a long time champion of this place for several years now. He swore to me up and down that it was amazing; so my wife and I made the long journey from south phoenix to glendale to see what this place was all about, and I have to say, I'm happy we did. We tried a wide variety of their rolls, and while I know sushi is typically expensive, this place was well priced for the quality we received. We tried the volcano roll, which was amazing. The combination of flavors was superb, it was a bit much to take in. My only criticism of it would be that it was a little too saucy, but still good. Then we moved onto the jalepno poppers, not sure what they were called, they were delicious! And just the right amount of spice. The las vegas roll was good, exactly what you would expect. The dragon roll, which is just eel on top of a california roll was great. We got a roll that had shrimp tempura in it as well and it was delicious, crunchy on the inside, not soggy like some places you go to. Overall, I would say this is my favorite sushi place in the valley, with a very close second being Sushi Eye (they're just too expensive, and the quality doesn't justify the price). If you go here, you will love it.",real
I had the trick in and my hubby ! I shared a burger with the Tomato brulee. Service was quick. As a trendy Old Scottsdale place.,fake
"Service is always friendly. As a non-vegan person, I enjoy their treats just as much as regular baked goods. The texture of their baked goods are denser and slightly gummier than regular goodies which is common with vegan goodies. Everything is pretty cheap for what it is; some people take the trendy ""vegan"" label and run with it but no singular baked good at Poisonberry is more than $4. They also sell a few coffee drinks, kombucha, jerky, and other assorted snacks.",real
I've never had a bad experience here at this location. The usual bartenders that we have are always on the ball to the customers. Yes I know that's their job but ive been to places where those were things you dreamed off.,real

"Current obsession: Herbs & RyeI've sat at the bar both times and have been wildly entertained both times. The show stopping bartender is Spotty who somehow manages to mix cocktails like a boss while still taking great care of the people right in front. During my first visit he and Joe took great care welcoming me as a first time guest. Stopped, shook my hand, asked my name, welcomed me to Vegas. I felt like royalty! I drank the Hemingway Daiquiri which forever changed the way I think about the Daiquiri cocktail. Not overly sweet. Tart. Delicious. The filet sliders are juicy bites of heaven. You know it's going to be mouth wateringly delicious when they ask what temp you want the meat on your sliders. The bruschetta flatbread was refreshing and delicious. The showstopper was the shrimp cocktail. I want to go back in time and thank that shrimp for its service. Before I left Joe asked where I was headed. He made a ""boomerang cocktail"" message to take with me to the Velveteen Rabbit bartenders. I already feel at home at this place. So much so that I went back the following night and enjoyed their HH steak. The New York strip was a steal!! Garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus + all the cocktails makes for a delicious evening. See you soon because I'm going to boomerang my booty back asap.",real
"Chicken burrito was good really hit the spot. The menu is sure to please. Became a bit full as customers gathered, maybe because there  is no ""serving"" area. Also would be better with an accessible door for those who need it.",real
"Great food, Amazing service and staff, definitely will be going back again and again .",fake
"We have driven passed Peachtree Southern Kitchen and often thought about stopping to eat. I'm glad we finally did!  Everything from the drinks to the main course was amazing. Even our server, Jacob, was awesome!  We will definitely be back!!!",real
"I love this place!  Food is phenominal, and the workers are always friendly.   My Husband and I have been to this location a lot and service is good. The guys that work there are super nice and very accommodating.",fake
"I love CUT so much. I could probably end this review there, but its heavenly goodness deserves an actual descriptor.I practically, and sort of literally, live in Las Vegas and this is one of my family's go-tos for our joint favorite meal: steak.  They serve excellent quality meat and good preparation.  Sometimes I look at my own pictures and drool a little because I remember how fantastic the marbling is.  And what's more, there's a cut for everyone.  I love the Illinois corn fed rib eye because it tastes like cow, and my father loves the softer Wagyu style, among others.  We've tried most of the steaks on the menu, and I've never been disappointed before.As if that were't enough for me, I like everything before and after the steak, too.  The pretzels are pretty much fantastic, especially with the assorted mustards (the other breads are good, too).  Heirloom tomato salad was great when it was on the menu, but there are a lot of other good choices too, like the warm asparagus that I love so much.  The sides are admittedly not CUT's strongest point, but it's not so bad and frankly, they're really not important.  If you care that much about sides, you may want to go somewhere that actually plates your steak.  Here they serve it to you as it is: solitary in its meaty glory.Dessert is surprisingly strong here, too.  Last I went, we ordered a souffle, baked alaska, banana cream pie, AND a warm berry cobbler.  Everything was good.  I ate to a point of serious discomfort because I couldn't stop.  It was too good.  Admittedly the souffle was sort of standard fare for a ""good"" chocolate souffle, but everything was clearly very, very good. Very.  I would be hardpressed to pick a favorite.All in all, if you can afford the price, go. Get a wine pairing or a cocktail. It's all good.",real
Absolutely wonderful. They have two food selections and the drinks are always good. I highly recommend this to all my friends.,fake
"There are very completely modest flavor, the service is wonderful and the staff is super friendly ! I highly recommend this place for a great dinner and a fun night out. I highly recommend the beef and lobster and the other snack. It was so good ! The Tom Kha soup was delicious! Our waitress Samantha was amazing and was very attentive. We will be regulars.",fake
This is the perfect place to eat at Yoka! The staff is very friendly and they keep it simple with all the sauces they get are amazing !! Highly recommended! Don't have time stop by for a real lunch spot.,fake
"I live right next to it so I shop here very often. The produce and fruits are guaranteed fresh. The selection of cheese is very good and they have many different varieties. They let you sample cheese too! All you need to do is ask. Some times they have special expensive cheese on discount. I got the truffle cheese for just around $7. The baked goods and breads are very delicious. The cakes and desserts are not too sweet or sour. My favorite is the fruit tart. They have a wide range of wines. I see a lot of deals going on all the time. One of the most convenient things about Whole Food is that they have hot food like breakfast, lunch and dinner and a dining area where you can sit down and enjoy your food. The food is a bit over priced but it is definitely good quality. I usually shop flowers here too because some time they have deals where it is only $4 for a bouquet of tulips. But overall the flowers are very beautiful and a bouquet is relatively big",real

"If you are looking for the best Italian restaurant in Phoenix you need to try Anzio's. We were greeted with a smile and exceptional customer service. Hostess, waitress, and owners all ready to make our experience fabulous! I had the chicken and broccoli alfredo  with a side of meatballs with sauce. Wow! Huge portions! Very delish! My husband got the trio which was chicken parmesian, lasagna, and fettuccine alfredo. He will definitely order this again. And the garlic bread... Yum! Our daughter got the children's fettuccine alfredo and enjoyed her smaller portion so she could have dessert. The cheescake was perfect! Not too rich but just right!  I always say the wait staff is what ultimately makes your food taste even better. This restaurant gets 5 stars from us for delicious Italian cuisine, excellent wait staff and comfortable atmosphere.",real
I agree with everything the previous review said. This place is as authentic as it gets on this side of the border. My regular order is two tacos al pastor and a manzanita. The people here are friendly and helpful. They used to be open until 3am on the weekends but I think that has changed. They also operate a food truck on McDowell between 24th and 32nd Street on the North side of McDowell.,real
"Oh how I love this place!We came here last night with friends so they could experience the joy of Lahore Tikka House. The last time my husband and I were here, we were eating in trailers... now we were seated in the new building.Not knowing what to expect, I was afraid that the building would spoil the charm of this wonderful Pakistani restaurant but to my surprise (and joy!), it hasn't at all! It truly is quite the experience eating here.The new building is spacious and open with somewhat of a 'market' feel to it... it's quite literally, a roof over your head. You still feel very much connected to the outside but that could possibly be because one wall is completely open to, what I can only think to call, the asphalt dining area.We devoured:Two Lamb Kabob/Chicken Tikka Rice - $12.95Aloo Gobi - $8.50Lahori Beef Kabob - $2.35 (each)Chicken Tikka Masala - $12.25Chana Masala - $8.35Garlic Naan - $2.25 (each)Butter Naan - $1.99 (each)First off, the naan has got to be the best I've ever tasted! It's soft and chewy and perfect for wiping up all the left over sauces on your plate. So delicious.All of the meat was seasoned beautifully and cooked to perfection. The rice that came with the lamb kabobs was incredible and there was certainly plenty enough for sharing.Our vegetarian dishes did not disappoint either! I knew before I stepped in the restaurant that I was having their Aloo Gobi again and it was just as fantastic as I remembered! The Chana Masala was ordered 'hot' and had a pleasant heat to it; not the kind that burns your taste-buds but rather leaves your lips tingling with wonder.All of the staff at this restaurant aim to please and ensure that your dining experience is one to remember. I was glad that we arrived when we did (6:30ish) because by the time we left, they were lined up down the street... of course, that might have had something to do with Eid al-Fitr as well. ;)",real
"One week later and we had to come back again and this time we brought a friend. The snow roll is the best roll we have experienced anywhere and highly recomended by us. We just dont believe it can get much better. We've been to almost 30 places now but still have a dozen or so left to go. This will be hard to beat, but, we'll see.......",real

"Second time back was even more impressed! I went for the first time in 2008 with the girls as we hit up Vegas. We 'waited' at the bar to see if we could get a table as you couldn't make reservations back then. Definitely not patient enough to get a seat on the patio we were seated 1/2 way through our first round of wines....no complaints here. We each got a few appetizers for the table and the ONLY thing I can remember from that first trip is the beef carpaccio. It literally melted in my mouth! So headed back to Vegas for welcome in 2011 with my fiance (a magnificent cook and foodie) and 3 Australian friends. As I have been to Vegas before I wanted them to choose what they wanted to do....I had one request....ONE dinner at Olives. So we saved it for our last night. On a whim (the morning of) I went to our concierge to ask about a reservation and to my surprise she called and got us a 5:30 seating! Upon our arrival we were seated immediately. My one concern is they really packed us in there but I wasn't complaining! It was a Saturday night and I was beside myself. Bread basket has some crunchy flat cracker with seeds that went super well with the olive tampenade. I prefered the black over the green. And they should consider not chopping the olives so much...it almost was a puree but still soooo tasty. They also included a cranberry walnut chocolate roll in the bread basket. It was sweet and I was surprised it was in the before dinner basket but really liked the flavor :) I don't think I will ever turn down chocolate, I don't care what course it is on.Terry (fiance) ordered the Layer Cake, a Malbec from Argentina. Spectacular choice, we even ordered a second bottle. It is a great red that goes well with everything we ordered....and at a decent price (for restaurant wine pricing that is). I can't wait to find this for a cheaper price at my local liquor store! :)Of course I ordered the beef carpaccio as it was burned in my memory forever. I was not let down....it was as good, if not better, than I remembered!Kate ordered the flatbread specialty, a wild mushroom flatbread. Very rich and filling. Bevo ordered the tuna tartare, I was especially surprised and pleased with this pick! I love tuna but this seemed just so delicate and fresh. Patty ordered the squid and octopus which was served with some garbanzo beans and a smokey broth....I was really surprised of this flavoring but really enjoyed it as it was a way I have never had it seasoned and flavored before.  For dessert Terry and I split the Butterscocth brulee. Magnificent! (and butterscotch is not my first preference when it comes to dessert flavors) This dinner just wouldn't have been complete without it. I also tasted Patty's espresso martini that was perfectly balanced of espresso and liquor!So although we didn't do entrees we were all stuffed and each got out with about $50/person including wine and with being able to taste so much!If I EVER make it back to Vegas my one requirement will be to make it to the patio to watch the fountains from Olives, my favorite place in Vegas!Synopsis:1. Get a reservation if possible (on the patio if nice weather) or be prepared to wait for a table....it is worth it!2. Order the beef carpaccio, you will not regret it3. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!",real
Food is awesome and reasonably priced.  The owner and employees are super friendly.  Steve the same great food.  Something else you get a groupon for dinner is a must!!!  Can't wait to try the rest of the menu!!!,fake
"I have been underwhelmed with many of the new & hip downtown restaurants I have been told I ""must try"". This was not the case wit Pizza People Pub. Right out of the gate I was happy with how I was greeted and seated. For such a new restaurant the customer service was already in line.The Honey Ginger Soy Wings were great. Meaty and cooked well with veggies and dipping sauce on the side. There were a bunch a good looking flavors and I will be back to try them. There are a handful of Mac & Cheeses on the menu. I had the Bleu Cheese and it was really tasty, cheap, and plentiful. For the pizza I tried their Hottie. Serrano, jalapeno, house made sausage, with some fresh chiffonade basil on top that really brightened it up. The crust was delicious and not greasy which I always like. It held up well to the toppings and wasn't a limp mess.  I loved loved loved the sausage. Fennel seeds in sausage always score points with me.A lot of new artisan pizza places go for combinations that just seem like they watched to much Food Network when they were designing their pizzas. PPP got their toppings sorted out with their food truck and they serve up smart and delicious combinations. The chef clearly focused on flavor and did not tie the menu to traditional American or Italian pies. I thought it was ballsy to go for this type of pizza place so close to Pizzeria Bianco but I think their well thought out and executed menu is going to surprise people in the area. This isn't really a negative just an FYI...although the menu would leave you to believe there is a sports bar theme with lots of TV's for watching games...there are not. It is a comfy place with good music and a great place to hang with friends.",real
"BEST.COFFE.EVER. if you want a chill vibe and some good coffee, come here! You will not regret it! SUPER family friendly and they make you feel super welcome. I had no idea what to order so I went with their recommendation  and won't go back!",real

"After hearing about the opening of this Egyptian restaurant, I had made it a mental note to come and pay this place a visit.A close knit group of my friends and I popped in today, and after I spent some time trying to explain each dish to them, we decided to just go ahead and order a variety of appetizers and different main dishes so that we could try as much variety as possible (because anyone from an ethnic background knows that no matter how hard you try, some dishes are simply impossible to describe!).We had 6 appetizers including baba ghanoush, pickled eggplant, moussaka, tahini, tomato with cheese, and koshary, and we were all impressed by the food. I can't speak for the eggplant based dishes because I am not an eggplant fan, however everyone else loved them.The main dishes we had varied from different plates of foul (Egyptian style fava beans) to eggs with egyptian pastrami, and egyptian falafel. Again, we were all very impressed and definitely made it a point to taste every dish on the table.After having some tea and dessert we asked for the bill to be split evenly amongst us (6 people) and were super surprised to find out that we only owed $18 per person....After all those appetizers, main dishes, dessert, tea, and 9 (yes, NINE) cans of pop, we only had to pay $18 each??? Not only was the food great and the prices even greater, but the restaurant itself has a charming vibe with great decor, pictures of iconic actors and singers on the walls, authentic furniture shipped in from Egypt, Egyptian music, and even Egyptian TV. All in all, 5 stars. For those of you looking for good, cheap, authentic Egyptian food, make sure to pop in here! And while you're at it, make sure to say hello to the super friendly Albert (the young entrepreneur who owns this restaurant). Enjoy! :)",real

I can have cheesecake here! That gets it a 5 by itself. One of our visit we got a really horrible server. We sent an appetizer back because we misunderstood what it was. After that she transferred us to another waitress. By that time we had already been waiting for our food for 45 minutes and by the time we got it, it was all wrong.  So why the positive review? This was an isolated incident. AND the manager comped the entire meal and gave us free deserts. So yeah, they still rock.",real

Haven't tried the weekend buffets, but they sound great, and the usual weekday one was excellent. One of the features we liked best was the made-on-site achar, very fresh, not overly spicey, crisp, refreshing. The garlic naan are to die for, and the lamb kebabs were spectacular. I don't think there is anything better in Pittsburgh. Don't do take out, eat in, get the best of it while it's hot.",real

"Fresh and simple.  The owner Jacque is quite passionate about his burgers that he lives and breaths burgers all day long.It's not as fancy as Burger Priest but if you want just a good tasting burger, Fresh burger is the place to go.  No fillers and daily grounded beef ensures that you get the best tasting burger that your mouth can handle.  If any can compare this with Hero burger, they must have went to Freshco and ate some burgers from the frozen section that's been in the freezer for over a year.Double prime burger was flavourful and juicy, but I had to forgo the fries to make room for the extra 6oz patty going into my stomach.  Best burger uptown!",real

It is a good sign when you walk into a restaurant and see that the  majority of customers are of the same native as the menu. This is my experiance.  The food was great!  Service was friendly and helpful in selecting dishes. Prices are very well priced.  One of the best Indian resaurants in the country!!!,real
Everything was superb. We had a few hiccoughs as any new restaurant will have but the staff handled it with grace and we were very impressed with the end result.I had a 24oz dry aged bone in porterhouse for $49. Ordered medium rare and it was cooked exactly right.,real

Good food. Good prices. Great service. The food was amazing. A bit overpriced but worth it. The staff was very friendly and attentive.,fake
"The best pudding I've ever had, ever. Get a lot of small plates to share. Ambiance is great and the servers are knowledgeable. Wouldn't change a thing!",real
Great food and prices! What else can you ask for?I usually go for the cherry on top if you're in the tapas alike. The sandwiches are awesome and the jerk chicken is so flavorful. The service is excellent and the owner is great. Definitely recommend it.,fake
"SO GOOD!!! Sausage, Mushrooms and basil... and it came out QUICK!!!The size is just right for 2 and the price was reasonable for a resort pizza place.Everyone working on this stop was friendly and helpful. I wanted to hug each of them.If you are in a hurry, this is an excellent stop.if you want to sit and people watch, you are in luck as well.ENJOY!!!!!",real

"Nigiri tasting menu was excellent, price for fatty tuna is actually 1/4th what you would pay on the strip at 6-7$ each, and higher quality to boot!",real
"Better than a Chipotle Chinese restaurant! Perfect ending in and serving great quality food. The prices are great too. my favorite so far. Personnel flushes & the cucumber margarita lol pizza was excellent!!! Service has been good too. If you are the newsonly time because I have to stop in at this restaurant on our way back to Vegas, every once in a while and the coffee is great. They serve over the gold standard for personal pizza. The best restaurant in Vegas.  Highly recommended.",fake
"I've never had a roasted artichoke - or any kind of artichoke,  until I was brought by a good friend to WCG...I must say...DELICIOUS! The atmosphere was calming and relaxing and quite romantic. Service was impeccable and the food was served quickly and was really satisfying! I will be back for more! I didn't have dessert as I knew it would be WAY too good! I do recommend the drive to get to WCG if you don't live close by. It is worth it!",real
I love this place! They always have delicious food and the service is always fast.  My steak was cooked perfectly and the maki dish was excellent. I would recommend it to anyone!,fake

"This is an update to upgrade my rating from 4 to 5*.  I don't do this very often but I am compelled to do so because it's safe to say this is my new favorite place to eat near home, period.While I will always have my favorite shawarma place by work (Zesty Pita - 2 locations), Palmyra is now a no brainer new favorite by home not just for Mediterranean food but for FOOD, period.  Yes, Palmyra has unseated Zet's as my favorite large portion, reasonably priced, close to home restaurant.  If you know me that's a pretty big title to take away because Zet's is like my jam but now Zet's will just become my late night 24 hour jam.While I have not had all of the menu yet at Palmyra, I've had enough of it to know that their food and the care they put into it is special.  ALL their food is fresh.  Their servings are beyond generous and their pricing is more than reasonable.  The quality of their food and the way it's presented is top notch.  IMO for what Palmyra offers and for what they charge they put places like Paramount to shame.  Palmyra to me is the epitome of great food at a great value so I feel lucky they are so close to where I live.The fact that my wife also loves this cuisine and loves this place as well it's safe to say we will frequent Palmyra pretty much forever.  I think if I say anymore I'll just sound like I'm gushing.  I can't say enough good things about this place without sounding like I'm obsessed with it.  It feels like this place is an amazingly well kept secret but I want to share it with everybody.",real
"I liked this place been searching for good burgers but this one by far is one of my favorites. Everything I've tried is amazing, that is the best one that I would give it a 2 hour for me for buying other restaurants and some food to go with the absolute best choice for a dinner and a great burger.",fake
Fantastic food and ambiance. I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys spicy salsas.,fake
"A colorful yet refined interior that is conveniently located in the lobby of Aria. It's my third time coming to Julian Serrano and even though there are a great amount of choices and restaurants to explore in Las Vegas, I always make this restaurant my must goto. Wonderful selection of Tapas that are delicious. The more people you go with the better it is as you can order varieties of tapas to try over a course of time with some Sangria and finish the meal off with one of the best Paella you will ever have. Please keep in mind that the Paella takes anywhere from 45-60min so please make sure its the first thing you order. I always go with the Mixed Paella which is my personal favorite with everything from seafood to Chicken and Spanish Chorizo in it. The minimum order is two but might be a bit much for two if you have some tapas. The staff will tell you exactly how much you will need to order according to your number of parties and amount of tapas you order. Service is top notch! The servers are very helpful and the managers were nice enough to take off the paella this time due to a 15minute delay which we really didn't mind.",real
Went here a couple days ago and was very pleased! It was my first time trying the sushi burrito trend so I don't really have anything else to compare it to but it was delicious! I got the Long Beach and I have no complaints. Would definitely recommend if you like sushi! And the price point is great considering the amount of food that they give you!,real
Nice sushi! I love the Champaign-Urbana. The price is a little higher.,real
"Watched it get a permit, watched it being constructed, watched it's grand opening, and am now sitting here, sipping hot coffee, surrounded by mostly senior citizens watching the traffic fly by on Grand. What's not to love? Xmas stockings are up, xmas blend is on tap, cams tree is up too. There's even cams stickers on the window. Happy Days.Nearly forgot. Service is quick (considering its first thing Saturday AM), it's clean, the staff are chatty and audible, the products are as expected top quality and to order. I don't have one single gripe.",real
"Amazing food and excellent service! They even have sodas and other Detroit native foods! Whether you're from Michigan, or just a fan of great food, this place MUST be on your list. Definitely check them out!",real
"It's been well over a year since I have been here, but I sure miss it.My boyfriend and I have been here several times and it became our spot when we were in AZ. Our favorite dish is the trio of tempura, teriyaki salmon, and California rolls. Also the tempura rolls are yummy and I cannot find anything that comes close to them in Illinois. Service was quick, but I don't recall anyone being that friendly. Prices were reasonable too, portions ample.",real
"It was a Sunday at about 8:50pm and I headed to Maxim.  I arrived at this little hole-in-the-wall location only to realize they were closing.  I was greeted by a woman named Maggie who kindly told me she could make a to-go order if that was okay.  Having worked in food service for several years I was surprised that she didn't just send me away and I was happy to agree.I ordered the Lemongrass Tofu and the Shrimp & Pork Eggrolls.  I also requested a side of peanut sauce because it's one of my favorites.  Maggie put everything together, told me to make sure to stop in for one of their lunch specials and off I went.  As everyone has previously stated, the prices are definitely affordable and I couldn't wait to get home.The lemongrass tofu is packed with flavor and it was cooked perfectly.  When mixed with the white rice and peanut sauce this little dish is amazing and it's a steal at $6.  I then unpacked the eggrolls.  I was excited to see that they came with mint and lettuce to wrap them in because I think that always adds another dimension of flavor and freshness.  Again, for a $3 item this exceeded my expectations and anyone would be hard pressed to find a better tasting eggroll in the Valley for up to twice the price.  I was so stuffed after the eggrolls and half the tofu that I saved the rest for leftovers for my next day's lunch (it was still amazing reheated).The Pho is just as good as everyone says, the Chicken Egg Foo Yong is probably my favorite and all of the lunch specials are incredible for $6 - $7.  Based on the quality of the food, the affordable prices (lunch is even cheaper if you can believe it) and the kind service from Maggie I give Maxim a solid 5-star review.  Maxim has become one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix and I think everyone should give it a try.",real
"I love stopping by this place. They have a great variety of sandwiches depending on your mood and the prices are spot on.  I usually get the regional, which is fantastic.  Their monthly/weekly specials are also amazing, especially the gyro tacos! Also, this place gets an extra star for the GREAT customer service that I get every single time I come in.  They are so fast and courteous and always offer to help me out any way they can.",real
"We came in for a bbq portion, but the food was good. Portions were huge. Great value. Definitely a must if you are in town!",fake
We decided to go and try this place last night. It was quite quiet (but it was 8 pm on New Year's Day). The staff were very friendly and explained the specials to us and gave us the time we needed to decide what we wanted to order. They brought us tea which was hot ( had to let it cool off a bit before drinking). We ordered the 32 piece of sashimi along with 2 rolls. The rolls came quickly and were delicious. The sashimi were of good size and fresh. The price is comparable to other sushi places. If you spend 25$ you get a card with a stamp and after 5 stamps you get a free dragon roll. My wife and I both enjoyed Main Sushi (food and friendliness of staff) and will certainly return.,real
"Great place to eat, great food and most importantly in a space of the top of our neighbourhood for years. There are plenty of items on the menu that you will not be disappointed. Try the feta and spinach shrimp. Best in the area.",fake
"This place is outstanding! Great food, great service, and very reasonably priced. The staff is friendly.",fake
"The new Grand Lux Cafe in The Palazzo was a dream come true for girls on a bachelorette party and on a time schedule on a budget. Humungoloid portions, like share it with 3 people, not 2, and the food quality was top notch. Even the lunch portions are monsterous!We ate there right after we checked in and everything we ordered was on point. It kept  me full for hours. I wish i could have tried one of their ready to bake desserts because they sounded delish! Our waiter was cool, but, I think he was trying to practice his amateur comedy stand up routine on us. After awhile, I felt like saying, ""Ok! Enuf! Just get me more bread!!"" Hahahahaha! But, I'm really not that mean, so I just giggled!",real
We had to go back again the next morning!  They have the most delicious french toast with berries and whipped cream.  They have this amazing aged Bourbon maple syrup to go with it - which seems lighter yet super complimentary to an already sweet dish.,real
What I imagine eating a baby tastes like. Unbelievably delicious. Fries were a total let down though... Shouldn't even be on the menu.,real
Definitely the best meal of my life and Ernest was the best server and gave us the most amazing recommendations and and was so sweet and made our experience so much better,real
"Best BBQ in town and the service is always top notch! I've been wanting to try this place for the past 4 years and wish I don't live in Montreal. I've been to a lot of Pho, and all of them are great too. Their guacamole is excellent as well!",fake
"Great place to spend a business trip or a bit, and have white tables to enjoy in the area. Why we had a bit more small business where the other casino?""   6 stars for service present.",fake
Best Thai in phoenix. And love the ambiance of the place. Their tea is perfect when they have food that you can't find at.,fake
"My Sister and I ordered take out, the grilled chicken and the BBQ pork Banh Mi, I also ordered a carrot smoothie and she ordered a Thai tea.  The sandwiches were soooooooooooooooooooooo good and the carrot smoothie was awesome.  Three sandwiches and two drinks under $17!! Great deal!!!

Excellent food and service. We went here for a meeting at this place and they need to check out this lovely please.,fake
This place has excellent pizza. I get the Chicken and waffle and a chicken biryani.  It was so tasty!  The bartender guy was very knowledgeable and helpful.  They have a large pepperoni pizza and a salad that is prepared to perfection. The service is not too bad.,fake
"Went to the Works yesterday and there are so many burger options that I wanted to vomit.   I got a chicken burger (black safety meat) and it was so delicious!! I want to regurgitate it just to eat it again!  I got the sweet potato fries as my side dish, but they did NOT provide chipotle dip or mayo so, that pretty much killed my buzz with those. Their regular fries are titilating though.  The only thing I didn't really care for was the measuring cup water glasses.  I mean, I know these are hipster times, but just gimme a regular glass, not a wide hipped beaker  I DID enjoy the light bulb salt shakers tho.  The burgers are like, $12 so you can't really eat there everyday, but you know what?  My mouth is watering as I write this.   I can't wait for an appropriate time to go back. I also used their washroom and it was clean enough to consider ""covering"" instead of ""hovering.""  I like to put the tissue on the seat regardless, in case I lose my footing as I hover. FIVE STARS!!!!!!!!!",real
"Tasty, quick and accurate, all time favorite specialty pizza.",fake
"I've walked on the USS Enterprise's Transporter! One minute I'm in Phoenix and the next I'm at a Greek family's home. I was welcomed with a glass of Ouzo as if I was the lost Uncle Frank not seen for years!   I sat at the bar (which I never do) to chat with the owner. He tells this restaurant has been around for 42 years and it's easy to see why.    The Mediterranean Greek Salad with grilled chicken for $11 was my order. Wow! I am truly have left Phoenix for Greece! The lettuce cold and crisp, tomatoes, cucumbers and Kalamata Olives are fab too! Coming back tonight for dinner- it's that good!",real
Delicious!! I have been waiting to try this for a while now since my girlfriend told me about it!Come into the restaurant with a live band playing right behind us! Think they sang happy birthday about five times. They have a sword of meat that comes around and the servers cut off a piece for every customer! You use these personal tongs to grab the cut of meat from them and they move on. Your table has a card for them to know if you want more (fire it up) or no more (cool it down). That will gauge your serving time. They come around faster than you think! It was such a great experience. There's also an all you can eat salad bar which was filled with my favorite Greek food! Yum yum! Definitely recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it. Its about $37 a person. Not bad for ayce meat!,real
Wonderful and healthy alternative! The customer service is fantastic and the restaurant itself is on point with all fresh ingredients beautifully displayed.,real

I can't get enough of this place. It is by far my favorite restaurant in Montreal. Huge selection of arepas to choose from. Give the chorizo de jabali or shark a try. So good! Where they really get you is the sauce. Load up your arepa with green avocado sauce  the lather on some red spicy sauce. DO IT EVERY BITE. The house juices are fresh squeezed and delicious. If I lived on this side of town I would be in here every week. You can't go wrong.,real

So I've lived in the Ballantyne area for quite some time and noticed a new Asian/hibachi restaurant where five guys used to be near duck worth ...I decided to stop in and check the place out. Upon entering I was amazed at the remodeling they did it's a very cozy and relaxed environment. With red and blue booths and chairs. I looked up above the register to see 4 tv screens displaying their full menu. I decided to order hibachi chicken and steak with fried rice. The price was decent not bad compared to other Restaurant for lunch. The lady told me to hold onto my receipt as she would call my number. I quickly found a seat and they bought my food out. The presentation was very pretty ...decent amount of chicken and steak with some veggies. The steak was tender served with a side of shrimp sauce. Drinks were self served. Over all I was very happy with my experience here and will be back again to dine in with my family.,real
"Had the eggplant and zucchini chips and loved them! Very thin, light, not greasy and the yogurt sauce was perfect. Then did a 3 side platter of risotto, mushrooms and cabbage olive salad which I loved! Lemon and olive oil cabbage with a few calamata olive slices was so light and fresh. The risotto was cooked to perfection, creamy but not overpowering and buttery. The mushrooms were one of my favorites really enjoyed the reduction they'd sautéed them in. Finally they gave me a sample of cream of spinach and Greek lemon soups. Lemon is in everything I cook and drink so you know which one I chose but the spinach was creamy but not heavy and would have made a great lunch choice all on its own. Overall - 5 stars! Loved the inside of the place too and there is seating outside. Classy, clean, warm I can't wait to come back!",real
"Very nice decor, complementary edamame, and good sushi. What more can you ask for? The service was good left with a full tummy :)",real

"I love the food here. Recently I have been really into tempeh, organic food, and in the end vegan food. This is a great restaurant to convert people to the way of the bean, soy bean that is. I've eaten take out, where I mostly order the Dragon bowl. It is filling and delicious, it's a must have along with grilled tempeh. On one of my more recent trips I order a the living salad (I think) with tempeh and it was great and surprisingly filling. To start that day we had the corn bread with guacamole, very good. I've had it with both the guacamole and veggie butter, my favorite is with the guacamole, however I think everyone must try the veggie butter. I also shared the Uncheescake Cheesecake which was very good, I am still wondering what they put in it to make it soooooo good. If you are a vegan or enjoy eating healthy you must stop by here. If you want to bring some friends to try their first taste of a vegan restaurant, this is a great choice.",real
"I am not a fan of Buffets by any means; especially in Vegas.  I only do the usual Bellagio or Wynn and might squeeze in a Craving at the Mirage if I don't want to leave the hotel (dessert sucks) there.  I truly get disappointed at the Buffets and get frustrated with the onslaught of Asian people and their 1 in line for a party of 15 holding up the entire restaurant during Christmas and Chinese New Years (Yes Chinese not this PC Lunar crap!!).  With all the press in the magazines, I decided to try this place out for lunch on the way home and with 0 expectations, I was truly impress.  They have wine for us (sophisticated people...no pun intended) and beer for the bellies all included in the charge).  This buffet includes NY Steaks, Prime Rib, Tri Tip, Turkey, Lamb Chops, all in the carving station.  They have numerous, numerous, other choices.  It was amazing.  The dessert is must for me!  They have a great desert selection for a buffet with hot Lattes.  I read some of the reviews below and totally do not understand some people.  Some people will never be satisfied.  If you have any experience for Vegas, Christmas time and Chinese New Years is a time for Asian families to flock in herds to Vegas. They crowd the Buffet like no other. The service and quality will suffer.  Also, by reading some of the their reviews, they will never be satisfied.  The Holidays is going to be crazy.  I went there for lunch on a Tuesday and there was no line and nothing but Seniors eating away with us.  Our server was great with some friendly Southern hospitality.  This is my favorite Buffet",real
"I first heard of Carvalho's through a Facebook friend. I was intrigued. Intrigued because it's an ethnic food I had never thought of trying. I checked it out on Yelp, like I do and it was already well-reviewed and well-loved. This only gravitated me towards Carvalho's even more. This all happened...hmmmm...maybe two or three weeks ago. Now, I finally gave it a try and was no where near disappointed. The experience and the food lived up to my expectations. It was a late Sunday afternoon (today). Not a lot of clientele around, as I would expect at around 3:30 in the afternoon. I would say I came at a great time. No wait and I was provided immediate attention. We were asked if we had visited before; of course, I answered no. We were provided plenty of time to stare at the menu. The dishes; especially, the names (in Portuguese) were all new to me. Not to worry, there was English translation. I decided on two items: the Bobo de Caramao (shrimp bobo) and the Pao de Queijo (Brazilian Cheese Bread) as an appetizer. My companion selected the Moqueca de Peixe (seafood stew). I would say waited less than 10 minutes for our main dishes to come out. They looked amaaaazzzzing. I didn't try the Moqueca de Peixe, but it looked so good. I would see it's appearance was prettier than my dish, but my dish tasted incredible. It was creamy and had a mild flavor. My appetizer, the Brazilian Cheese Bread, came out a little later, but that's okay. It was a great complement to the abundance of creamy bobo I had left over. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The food was delish both in taste and aesthetically. I can't wait to come back to try the other dishes.",real
"Amazing. Simply fantastic.  Cannot say enough wonderful things.  My husband and I were in Vegas for our anniversary and decided to do a little celebrity chef steak comparison.  We ate at Craftsteak and Gordon Ramsay steak.  Craftsteak was the Hands Down winner in every category!   Food was incredible.  The cheese grits were to die for.  Steaks were simple and well cooked.  Food presentation was lovely.  Monkey bread for dessert was yummy!!  Where Craftsteak really stood out was in service.  The servers used a partner system, which worked great.  I believe our two servers were Marlon and Bleu.  One spent time walking us through the menu and the other took our order.  I liked this approach because it allowed one to make recommendations and the other took the order so you didn't feel badly if you didn't take their recommendations.   Overall, fantastic experience at Craftsteak - will definitely return on our next trip to Vegas and will certainly be recommending to friends.",real
"I absolutely love this place! Have been for both lunch and breakfast and both were amazing! I can't wait to go for dinner! Rumor has it their fried chicken is incredible...Can't wait to try it!

"Breakfast and lunch is one of my favorite weekend activities. Having lived in this area for over 20 years I'm always looking for a new breakfast spot. Located in the heart of Old Town Gilbert, it's probably going to be a wait every time you go. But man, it's worth it!! Spicy Bloody Mary's or Mimosas will hold you over while you wait out front by the fire. Inside you'll order a pancake flight or a flaky breakfast pot pie... or my personal favorite, the Eggs Benedict! You can order two different kinds, so definitely take advantage of that. And prosciutto with arugula and balsamic on top? Salmon lox? Yes please!! Everything is good here. Everything. Oh, and everyone was happy and nice too. I'll go back for sure!",real

"I LOVE THIS PLACE!  I've been eating sushi since I was a child and this is one of my fave places!  Roka is definitely a tad on the pricey side, but it is so worth it!  I don't know what training their wait staff attend, but every restaurant needs to copy them!  They are always courteous, friendly, and very informative.  The staff knows exactly what is on the menu at all time, including the specials, will inquire about your likes and dislikes and find something that you will enjoy.  I've brought a few friends here who had never ate sushi and each occasion the staff eases their apprehensions, found items they think my friends will enjoy, and they always leave being my new sushi buddies!  The food is delicious and I've never ate a single item I didn't love here.  I have traveled the world for both leisure and work, and this is definitely one of my favorite restaurants I've ever been to.",real
Get the spicy Mac n cheese and have sampled bacon!! The salsa bar is also amazing!,fake
Love this place.  The only problem is I have a hard time choose which meal to order.  It is a staple.,real
"We are from New Jersey and have been going to Hugo,s for many years. The atmosphere is lovely. We have never had a problem with the service. Our meals have always been over the top. We recommend this establishment to anyone wanting to experience the real old time classy Vegas.",real
This is hands down the best noodles in vegas. Great place. Eqsy simple menu. Perfect for hangovers,real
Excellent!!!!  Some of the freshest sushi & sashimi I have ever eaten.  Extensive menu with many specialty rolls.,real

We talked to the owner of a restraunt last time they had lots of variety of fresh ingredients. Love the beef and roasted pepper sauce. It's always been a good price!,fake
I love this place! I've eaten here many times and the food and service is excellent. Try the smoked pork belly salad - It is decadent! Great wine selection also.. Bravo !,real
"HIDDEN GEM.   This small mom and pop place was such a pleasant surprise.  The food was fantastic and very Mexico City style authentic. We ordered the choriqueso and totopos (chips)and salsa as an appetizer.  Both were excellent. The choriqueso had a nice spice mixed with the melted cheese.  The green salsa also was the best.  I had the mole as a main course and was not disappointed.  I loved the rich flavor of all the spices.  I can't wait to come back and try the ceviche, tamales and street tacos.",real
"Made a reservation, suggest it because even if it doesn't seem like you have to - you do. All sorts of people come here, and it is alacarte think Ruth's Chris or Flemings. Delicious, and just like the name definitely tender! Talk about cooked to perfection too- no extra sauces needed seriously taste better than STK! Plenty of natural flavor, we had two Organic New Zealand Ribeye grass fed ! Had the Brussels sprouts suggest if you're a healthy buff- cooked in organic chicken broth. Yummy!Our waiters were all awesome and attentive , receptionists were friendly also- all around a nice intimate setting for a special occasion or a sensual moment.",real
Cowboy Ciao is fantastic!There is a variety of great food. The staff is courteous and quick. It is family friendly and is fun environment. I cannot wait to go back!,real
Absolutely great sushi quality and service. One of the best sushi places in Toronto.,real
"My family and I had a wonderful breakfast here with great service. We came around 10am on Sunday morning and the 5 of us were seated within a couple minutes. The menu has a typical selection of a morning breakfast diner. My wife had bacon and eggs, my kids had chocolate chip cookie pancakes, and I had the crepe and eggs. I was happy to see that these were properly made banana crepes with powdered sugar since decent crepes are hard to find. The staff were friendly and the food came quick - I will defiantly be going many times into the future!",real
Okay so I'm a huge fan of the Aioli Gourmet Burger truck and to see they had a restaurant opening I was beyond thrilled! Once I arrived at the restaurant I was happy to see they expanded their menu so many more options to choose from!! The mac and cheese bites are super yummy along with the pretzel bites! Oh and the chocolate lovers shake is a serious must have!! My food was served fast and Hot! I highly recommend stopping in for a quick bite to eat.,real
"The best pasta I have had in Charlotte,  made fresh every day. The crab ravioli were out of the world. It was also refreshing to have great service for a change here in Charlotte.  Wine list was simple with some good values.  A plus will be going back soon.",real
"The atmosphere and people are amazing! The best service i have received. Clean, fun, friendly, and great Guacamole. It was my birthday and originally expected to go to another location but i am extremely happy we stumbled on this location. They went above and beyond good customer service and that is why i rated them so high. If you have not tried their Guac please do, its made every 4 hours and is delicious.",real
We've been here twice now - freaking delicious and excellent service friendly and attentive. Great customer service definitely find my mom's cooking!,fake

We had a wonderful time. The food was amazing with good portions. I recommend this place. Try the Green Curry.,fake
"Great food, great service, we went there at coupon for two seasons, and one if the best dining experiences I have had in Vegas. I will be back for sure.",fake
"This is my favorite restaurant in all of Vegas. The food is very good and the drink list/menu are untouchable for anywhere in town. This is a little off the beaten path, so if you are a tourist visiting, not only is it difficult to find, but a little tough to allow for the time away from the strip and everything else Vegas has to offer. Came here during NADA this year and was pleasantly surprised that my group of 8 was able to walk in, without reservations and enjoy a fantastic meal. We all ended up sharing things from steak to pasta to chicken. I also introduced a coworker to absinthe. They make it traditionally, so you get a show with the cocktail as well. Everything is so well done here, from the food to the drinks to the meticulously decorated interior. I absolutely love Herbs & Rye!",real
"I came back and as before, always good. This place is definitively my favorite in Pittsburgh for ice-cream. The waffle cone is amazing and every flavor is very tasty. A must try.",real
Love this place. Best bloody marys for the hang over. And great food. Steve o is the man. Always a good time,real
"This is a great restaurant to eat at the freeway that you can find in the champions on the West side of the world, and all the food is incredible. Service is great and food is always good. Sushi and sashimi tasted like home cooked foods. Also an oasis is always packed but a lot of fun. Everything is excellent from the service.",fake
Yummy Italian beef.  Very cool atmosphere and the staff couldn't be better.,fake
"Once you go in you will feel a very cool and chill vibe. The music in the room suits the interior designs of the place.The workers are so nice. They would ask questions to try to accommodate the customers. The foods are just fantastic! I ordered the ""good stuff"" (banana w/ nutella crepes) and it was well served. Crusty and toasty on top. I was eating it only halfway through and I was already full. It was surprisingly affordable. It was so worth it. I will sure come back over and over again with my friends. The only bad thing was it can be crowded because it's a small place but other than that it would be the perfect hang out place.",real
Absolutely fabulous! The burgers and the manakest soup is great.,fake
"Friendly staff, good food, inexpensive, and delicious, I love their gyros and the prices are very reasonable.",fake
This place has some amazing drinks good quality. This place is bomb! Best Al Pastor I'vh ever had!!! Also ordered a pork and a crab and shrimp with black bean burger and it was good. They will bring out different fries later.,fake
"Excellent food and service! We sat comfortably at the bar and started with the peppers and Brussels sprouts, which were both phenomenal. We all had ramen, which was also delicious. Brittany the bartender/server rocked...she was funny, knowledgeable and on it!",real
Always a great place!  You can have food for a family memories of any of the thempand experiences. One of our favorites in the area.,fake
I came back to this restaurant when i moved to Montreal. This is my favorite burger joint in the valley. The show steak is great  fries are good too. My favorite: it just melts in your mouth..,fake
Food is excellent!  Everything was fresh and prices are very reasonable. One of my top favorite Chinese restaurants in Vegas!,real
"Love this place, and the staff are very nice and friendly. We even got my money here and we will definitely be back.",fake
"They have the best vegan donuts EVER! I am in love with their donuts. Heck, even my non-vegan friends and family LOVE their donuts. They also have a great variety of pastries/donuts that would please every vegan. When I get cravings for some sweets, this is the first place that I go to. The people working there are incredibly nice! I love them as much as I love their food. They even give use extra stuff every time we go there. Overall, I'd recommend this place to the world.",real
"Finally moved to Central and Indian School...had Gadzooks for dinner my first night. So glad I'm in the area now, it's the only reason I moved here was to be closer to my enchiladas.",real
this is a great pizza place! $8 for a flatbread with any toppings! out in two minutes cooked perfectly. highly recommend,real
"This is my favorite place in the OCAD foodcourt, and easily the most popular place with long lineup everyday. Food is very cheap for its quality. I love the sweet and sour chicken especially. Most dishes tasted like Chinese food, except they also offer cook-to-order Thai specialty food (e.g. pai thai).",real
"Gotta go here all the time - fast and friendly service! If you're looking for a fun, high quality food, great service. This is my go to place. The fried rice and coleslaw dunkis is a must have!!!  The service is great! Go here for the fried chicken and waffles I believe inside preparing the pizza and will melt in you go and get some good southern fries.",fake
"This was my first time here!  The drinks were incredible and the server (I definitely got to get a slice of the bread, spicy shrimp with sesame inters between the white meat chicken, the other dishes and all the food is unbeatable. Perfect for this type of winter time at 10-11. Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu and we will be back again and again.",fake
A great place to eat.  Food was wonderful and the wait was a bit longer than expected for the long line but I did not have to wait long to finish the crab legs.,fake
This place is soooo wonderful to eat at. Got treated while in Vegas. The food is wonderful. The best steaks EVER!!! The food is pricey but it's worth it. The staff was very professional and kind. Drinks were awesome I recommend this place while you are in Vegas.,real
"Great pizza.   The bacon nivive sometimes like me.  Great bar, the wings are amazing too.",fake
"I love this place so much. This is why:1. VEGETARIAN GRAVY IS THE DEFAULT. They only have one gravy that is not vegetarian. They also offer a number of gluten-free gravies - although I do not know how well they protect against cross-contamination, so I would be sure to ask about that if you have Celiac disease. Sorry vegans but I can't remember if there are vegan cheeses available. Will ask next time and update my review accordingly.  2. Their poutines are DELICIOUS. So, so tasty. And you craft your own dish, from fries to gravy to toppings. WIN! 3. Great energy: awesome staff, chill vibe, great music choices. If you ask nicely, they will play any song you request - with accompanying music video.  4. Bounty of alcoholic beverages available. Poutine accompanied by bourbon on the rocks? Why not! Never change, Poutineville.**Unless you do not offer vegan cheese and a separate prep area and tools for gluten-free diners. If this the case, you should change a little.",real
"Went for lunch today. Ordered the red velvet pancakes, she had the chicken chow fun too. I had the pulled pork and it was well prepared and delicious. I'll definitely be going again!",fake
Amazing coffee!! So good I bought a pound of espresso. The turkey BLT wrap was so delicious. Only did a to-go order but the place was clean and busy. My husband was having dental work done and the receptionist recommended this place. Give it a try!!,real
"Best wings I've had so far in Phoenix, and i've been on a hunt to find a go-to spot.  Decent price, fries are annoying just because some are very short, then the next will be super long, but just grab a handful, dip em in ranch, shove em in your mouth and you won't be disappointed. The chefs special sauce and ATL style are my favorites so far. definitely will be back to try more! They cook to order, and getting a carry out takes me about 13 minutes to get home, nothing gets soggy, still hot and crisp! Give ATL a try, I doubt you'll be disappointed.",real
One of the best in MTL great atmosphere and the food is amazing always fresh fish and amazing drinks if you like Asian fusion check it out !! The chef is the nicest guy and he is so talented,real
"First time I've had ramen noodles other than what I make at home--a fancy version out of shin ramyun package that I buy at Asiana market. I always put egg and green onion! Was a pleasant surprise to taste these noodles. They were delicious! I added medium spice, which was perfect. No runny nose or watery eyes. Chicken gyoza was perfectly fried and the dipping sauce was not too salty. Great service and a small, friendly atmosphere. Space is limited, so I'm not sure how dinner is, as I was there during lunch with no wait, but it was almost full. I told my mom that it was both a good and bad thing that I found this place; good that I loved it, bad that it makes me want to cheat on my low carb diet haha. Definitely try it if you are craving a gourmet ramen bowl!!!",real
Great food and great service! This is my favourite sushi place! And the food is simply perfect.  I have never had a bad experience.  Thank you Ramen for winter time.,fake
This place is amazing. I love the tacos and baked goods...good bar.. Their business winter special gives a special touch............ Just make sure to get there early! But beware of the dining room.,fake
This place has tasty food. Great service too! I love the fresh fruit gravy Bowl and the Mac and cheese the best!!,fake
"I've never been disappointed by this restaurant. I've had calzones and pizza, and it's all been amazing every time. I came here with my entire family to celebrate my birthday, and not only was everyone really happy with what they ordered, I was also given a free slice of the best chocolate torte I've ever had.The complimentary bread + olive oil and balsamic vinegar is SO good, and the wait staff has always been very friendly, and this place is just really great. Definitely coming back.",real
"Just redic my friends. Just redic. The service is absolutely stellar and very helpful in helping you decide what you'll enjoy based on your appetite, craving and personal taste. The food? What can I possibly say that others on here haven't already said? It's f*cking amazing! Absolutely incredible culinary creations. Don't skip the foie gras, especially if you're going back home to less-than-foie-friendly California, OMGOMGOMG, so savory, so decadent.Their desserts, don't leave the MGM without trying at least 2 of em, wow, just wow.Whatever it takes, save your pennies, stay away from those darn penny slots and get your butt in here for dinner, especially if you're lucky enough to have someone special in your life to bring with you! =D",real

"Do you know how hard it is to get real, authentic chicken wings?!  Look no further.  ATL Wings in Arizona, has got to be one the best chicken wing places I have had the pleasure of eating in a long time.  I am a total food snob. My job has allowed me to travel the world, so I know good food when I see and eat it.  OMG, first of all the service was exceptional.  The staff knew their sauces and their stuff.  The chicken was crispy and juicy.  I have never had wings were the rub was spicy, but the heat didn't keep you from eating more.  I couldn't put them down.  There were 4 of us in the party and we were all VERY pleased.  The owners, John and Keyona Thurman have a hit on their hands, bring that to Massachusetts, they don't know what they are doing...at all...KUDOS, Mr. and Mrs. Thurman...outstanding...the prices were also reasonable.  The food is just wonderful!",real

"The chicken poutine was delicious! We stooded here enough to fit in an open monday downtown. Sit outside and play corrala bar for as a friend. They give you a bit of a wait but that is because it is a winner. The hummus isn't justiculand but the recipe, scallops and steak soup. Service was excellent, food was prepared in a timely manner so we went back to our table and experience food was fresh and delicious. Truly the place to go and get your burger.",fake
Best tacos in Vegas. I asked for some of the best burgers and they were all tasty! I would definitely recommend this place!,fake
"Started off with the Pork Belly Buns which were perfect. Just the right amount of smoky sweetness and a hint of heat.  Also had the Chaing Mai Curry. It was to die for. First of all it was a huge serving. Second,  it was just delicious.  So many nuances of different flavors. This was one of those dishes where I could have licked the bowl. And spicy just enough.Also had an extra hot Ginger Beer.  If you've never tried, try it.Great service too.  And we got to sit outside on a beautiful day.",real
Nice clean restaurant and waitress was very nice.  Our waiter was incredibly friendly and helpful.  :) Thanks Ashley!!! !,fake

My wife and I was satisfied with my dining experience there. Easy to go in and out eat. We were suggested to go here and I really liked our dining there. It was  pretty good  food. Their burger are large and filling and my wifey had salmon piccata  Yummy. A must dine place. Awesome!!!! 5 stars.,real
"Love this place.I've practically tried everything on the menu. I have been a customer since they were at their old location back in 2008. Obviously, things changed after they moved - especially the size of the location and the menu but the flavours are still just as amazing! Not necessarily authentic Thai but still amazing especially their Seafood Fried Rice with 5 chilles. Must have experience :)",real
"This isn't going to be much of a review because there isnt much to say... I don't want to act like I DONT frequent these types of estabishments - but for you people who know what a typical one is like then I have no problem with saying that this place is heaven.  Theres not need to be scared... they wont bite you, without a private room. I wish I could give more stars, as I've already given enough money to them. There must be at least 5 girls there that I've funded their entire college tuition.  Your welcome ladies.10 out of 5 stars......and thats all I have to say, about that.",real
"Cas on the date night pizza Parlor. This is the place. I love this Camelback place. Has a cute outdoor fireplace. Cool microbrews; nice wines. Best part... trendy eats. Antipasto...meat and cheese platters. All things I love on date nights. Pizzas are singular, in case your down with the funghi and he's all in for the meaty. Sandwiches, pastas, salads are very robust. Cut to dessert..or don't.. like me.. I drink my wine for dessert. Awesome staff to recommend what you may or may not know. No rush service. Trendy, vibrant ambience. Lively like it should be for the trendy area it is. So yummy. I was a pig pigster and ordered an extra singledom and took one home last time for the next day!",real
LOVE this place. Staff if always very pleasant. Every time I go it's a positive experience. The breakfast was great. It tastes like mom's home cooking. The burgers a great. It was $4 and some change for a cheese burger and fries. CHEAP for good a quality meal. I look forward to trying new things on the menu.,real
The only thing I can say is the house special chicken is my favorite! A must try.,fake
"What a great dinning experience at a restaurant by the famous Gordon Ramsay. I came here with fellow elite Melissa Y. because she had invited me for lunch. I could not resist skipping out on a celebrity chef meal right? I actually came here 2 years ago for a Yelp event and they have certainly made changes for the better. Before we ordered our waitress Carrie gave us a little run down on the background of the resto in addition to some of her recommendations from appetizers to entrees. I thought that was very nice of her to do that considering some people are clueless as to what they want to order. We started our meal with calamari which was suggested to us by Carrie. It came out pretty fast and I did enjoy it because the breading was quit different than what I'm used to. Typically calamari is more of a flour based breading and I could tell they used bread crumbs possibly? I liked it because it added a bit more texture to it and to add to that the squid was not rubbery which I have experienced at other places. The tartar sauce was had a home made touch to it, it was probably house made? For the entree, I had the pub salad. The protein in the salad was chicken, ham and shrimp. It may sound overwhelming, but it actually wasn't. The amount they put of each was just right, which made the salad still a light option. There was also little bits of apples, chickpeas, and cherry tomatoes which added to the freshness to the dish as a whole. Finally the red wine vinaigrette brought everything together and they did so by putting the perfect amount for the salad. I was definitely pleased because I did not want anything heavy because I knew I was going to have a heavy dinner. As we were eating we saw that a man in a suit walking around the resto asking customers how their food was, I overheard him say his name was Derrick. I assume he was the manager and it just goes to show how much they care about pleasing their dinners. While eating we needed re-fills on our drinks and caught the attention of a server by the name of Sara. Normally I don't like asking other servers for anything because they are assigned a certain area of tables. However, Sara  did so willingly and was very nice about it. She even said if there was anything else we needed to let her know. To top off our meal Chef Scott from Hell's Kitchen came our and introduced himself to Melissa Y. and I, totally unexpected. We were kind of star-struck too at the same time! Lol.. Anyway, this place has definitely improved this time around and I can't wait to be back.",real
This place is awesome!!!  I love everything about this place and the customer service - the location is consistently great.  Will return,fake
"I've been here a couple of times and it's been pretty busy. Feel free to sit at the bar; they'll still feed you there. The first time I order the Oggie and it was quite good. This past time I went for the Mexican and it was stellar. Just the right amount of spice and it served w/ salsa and sour cream as well. Be sure to order chips with your beverage or when you order your entree because they do take some time in the oven. Finally, if you're a beer drinker, I think you'll be quite pleased with the variety of beers on tap.",real
"Foodwise, this is one of the best restaurants in the city of Phoenix (yes, I include Scottsdale, as well as all of the other surburbs, in ""Phoenix"") and has terrific service to boot.Carefully created fun cuisine, with high quality ingredients. I wouldn't hesitate to send anyone here. Even those with a less than experienced palate can find something on the menu they will enjoy.",real
"Purchased the Groupon to try this place out. Took my girlfriend to have a nice dinner. When we arrived, I found there was plenty of parking space and in a really nice area. We were greeted immediately. There were no problems with our reservations. We chose a curtain booth, which, not surprisingly, is a booth with a curtain. The booth was pretty small, along with the table. Not too much room to eat or move plates around. But once you receive the delicious food, it doesn't matter. All the food was well put together and in generous servings, and the waitstaff was very intentive. They even accommodated a request for candles at the table. This is not a cheap place, but definitely worth it. I will be back in the future for more fondue deliciousness!!!",real
"Loved their other location, saw they opened one up across the street from my job, had to go there for lunch. They did not disappoint at this new location. Absolutely the best cheese steak I've had since i moved out west! The meat was cooked to perfection, the cheese was melted just right, n the bread was so soft! I also tried their bacon cheese fries, n for the first time in a while, I enjoyed cheese-wiz on something. Service was very friendly, it takes a little bit of time for them to make ur order, but it was well worth the wait, plus great food takes time to make! I was already a fan of theirs, now I'm a follower of theirs!",real
"So they have a lunch special lately and that's what caught my attention, it's $18.99 for lunch (all you can eat) but if you don't want to eat that much they have happy hour, 50% and on Sunday's they do happy hour ALL DAY. The all you can eat for dinner is $21.99 so now this sushi restaurant has THE BEST sushi prices and it's not bc the sushi is rancid, the quality of their fish is actually really really good. Kobe has some pretty good stuff, you order seaweed salad, or the poki salad and they give you LARGE portions it's totally worth the money you pay, plus the service is very good, sometimes slow but bc it's busy. Other than that the place is clean, very nice interior design, very good fish and interesting variety of rolls haha. Their miso soup tastes a little different from other miso soups I've had but it's not bad it just tastes slightly different. To also add they play some good music here and some old school 80's music hehe. I love the ambience it's pretty relaxing you don't feel bothered and you don't feel like people are listening to your conversations either. To also add their desserts are normal Mochi and ice cream BUT they put whipped cream on it to make it extra cute. I'd definitely recommend and I'm definitely coming back",real
"Plenty of TVs and a great place to watch sports if that's your thing. Food is delicious! Had the chicken pot pie and it was mouth watering! Good beer selection, and good crowd. Not douchy like the other bars on w25th on the weekends.",real
"WHATTTTTT!!! LE THAI WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE!!! Husband and I always go to commonwealth and we always say we are going to try this place because the smell is intoxicating when you are on the roof. Well, we finally got around to trying it out. The wait was 45 mins, but they have a service that texts you when your table is ready and you can see how many parties are infront of you, VERY COOL. We didn't want to stuff our selves on our first time there since we were going out after. We shared the beef appitizer with the waterfall sauce. SHUT YOUR DIRTY MOUTH LE THAI!!!! How dare you make something so tasty. Every time we go there now we always order extra of this yumminess. For our entree we shared the awesome noodles. They are exactly that, AWESOME. The next time we went I got the awesome noodles again because they were so good the flavors are perfectly balanced with the flavors and textures. Husband got the short rib fried rice, I had a bite or 5, haha, and had to stop myself from taking over his meal. The service is always great, they seem to remember us at this point now, which is always a great feeling. We expect nothing fast when we go because you can't rush greatness!!! The service is the same when it's just the 2 of us and when it has been 8 of us. OH and the price is pretty legit. When it is just the husband and I we spend under $20 when we share and under $30 when we don't.",real
"The food is on point, a taste like home made, (just need small table to play some dominos) lol",real
"Great atmosphere, craft beer on out weekend nights, our server, John was amazing, everyone was so nice",fake
This place is really something. Have been here 4 times already and have tried something new each time and have never been disappointed. Their meats are so flavorful and complement their special sauce so well. Can't go wrong with the wraps but go for their platters over rice. Up there with the likes of Halal guys in NYC!,real
"The difference of going for lunch vs. going for dinner is night and day, literally.The only reason we were able to get a table is because others cancelled. Seems to be fully booked on weekends.The view is amazing, especially at night.The duck was about a 4-star dish. I tried foie gras for the first time because it came with the duck and that was the dish I wanted, and if all foie gras tastes like this I'm never eating it again. I thought it was supposed to be this amazing stuff that was worth torturing ducks for. Not so much.Their sweet cherry bourbon cocktail was AMAZING. I had three. I could've drank that all night non-stop. It was delicious! Fresh house-made sour mix (with fresh lemon and lime), simple syrup, cherry bourbon... It was perfect in every way.The salmon appetizer was also very delicious.The chocolate dessert also was amazing. So delicious.This restaurant is really great for dinner. It's a very romantic setting. The view is amazing. Service is professional, attentive but somewhat robotic. A couple of times I had to ask for my drink or more water but usually they were great.Overall, awesome experience. Great place. I'm glad I gave it another try.",real
Pizza is really good. Chicago style dough is flaky and buttery and the sauce has a good balance of spice and sweetness,real
The views and the food!!!!  Came in for the views and were wowed with the food.  Food was very good and portions weren't skimpy.  Try to save room for desert.,real
"Ok yelpers...let's get one thing straight here. As far as FOOD is concerned, Thai E-San definitely has some of the best out there. My roommate is Thai and this is one of the only places she hits up on a regular basis. Food: AMAZEBALLS! All of their servings and portions are SUPER HUGE. The Spring Rolls are the size of cucumbers and only $3 for two of them. The Chicken Satay was also tasty with 6 skewers for about $8. Between the two of us, I think we've ordered about 1/2 of the menu, but I really enjoy their fried rice, pad thai, the stir-frys and the chicken curry. As a BIG fan of spicy food, I love how I can control the level of hotness for EACH plate. You can rank them from a 1-5, and the 5 is quite spicy and YUMMERS!Service: YES....YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT!! The food is prepared TO ORDER and unfortunately, the owners don't trust anyone else to make the food, so there's only ONE COOK!! I've never gone on a super busy night (because I KNOW better) so the longest I've ever waited was about 30 minutes, but since the food is SOOOO good I don't mind. The waitresses are really nice, but if you want assistance, don't be afraid to flag them down. They're happy to help.",real
"I love the food!! I had the Swedish sampler since I didn't know what to get. Everything seemed so good! And it was! I tried a bit from my friends dishes too and they loved it. They had the rhubarb chicken. I was so engrossed in my food that I forgot to take pictures,sorry. You will not be disappointed",real
Came here after a night of drinking. Shrimp burrito is the best thing on the menu. The restaurant is a little small and but clean and well prepared.,fake
Great tacos. Amazing. I have never had a bad meal here. I can not find the Omelet Everytime we order at this place 1st time in the last few months and we never been disappointed by the food. Especially if you dont like to spend a lot of time.,fake
UPDATE on Christmas Eve dinner. Amazing food at a reasonable price. Highly recommend going here.,fake
"Great little diner!  Stopped in because it was on our way to the zoo. The servers were super friendly and made us feel right at home. Great menu items and specials,and the food was awesome.  Who doesn't like country fried steak and cherry cheesecake waffles.",real

"Went in recently with some friends and my little boy as I have been bursting to try this place as I was always a regular at Victoria and Boda but hadnt managed to make the very short trek to Hemma!First of all I have to say the service was impeccable a warm welcome and prompt drinks service.  I love the decor its cool but relaxed and theres plenty of room which was a shock because if youve been to Victoria, Sofis or Boda they are quite small and a little cramped but dont let that put you off they are still fab!A brilliant menu my husband had the burger which was immense! I had the most amazing sweet potato, asparagus, feta and cant remember what else salad but it was lush and huge the bar guy that served us actually recommended putting chorizo into it which was dare i say it again IMMENSE! i think it was the best salad I have ever eaten amazing! Drinks were prompt, food was prompt, service was more than helpful - the people I were with were a little fussy but everything was perfect when it came to the table.  Loads of room and a great place to take children and they even have table football! Im sold !",real
I can't speak highly enough of the coffee and miss but that my sandwich is the kind of pricey but well worth it.,fake
"We had the fried calamari and it was amazing. They have all you can eat sushi but the bagels were fresh and very tasty. Maybe even on Chinese / charlestant.  I got my food in and out within 30 minutes, worth the wait!",fake
"Maria & Chino were awesome and took care of me! The strawberry mojito was perfection and fresh! They had an extensive gluten free and vegetarian menu. I ordered the baked tetilla, stuffed dates and stuffed peppers. It was mild in spice, but still delicious!",real

ONLY comer to this restaurant! The view is great and the food is delicious. My family and I always use the order in time to talk to their food. Staff was all friendly and helpful. Must try the Thai fried rice omelet and the chicken parm all ween. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Sapporos are the best I have had in town!,fake

My wife and I LOVE staying here. Every time we have a weekend get away here it gets better and better! The staff throughout the hotel are so friendly and make our stay enjoyable :),real
This is the best bbq in Vegas for the price. The place is a little pricey but it's very reasonable. I don't like the food but the atmosphere is what set up over and over here! Gotta try it out again!,fake

"I found out about this place when i came back to Montreal... Excellent food, and service, the staff very friendly, they have a great view of the fountain and the staff is friendly and helpful. Also, the food was amazing! Our office was greeted to customers service was great. My friend had a shine, lobster combo with garlic naan and seaweed salad. Yum!",fake
The best carne asada fries in scottsdale.  My only complaint is the Stephanie is always recognisive.  The manager Latine and Stephanie is our second time here and I love how they have great seafood to the wine!!!Try the red curry chicken......,fake
"This was my first time eating at Five Guys. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted and asked for my order. The wait time was under 10 minutes, so that was a plus. The atmosphere was also great because I felt welcomed. All of the workers were kind and seemed like they were happy to be at work. I received excellent customer service overall.After I got my soft drink from the fountain, which was also a cool experience because it was different from any other soft drink fountain I've seen, I sat down and prepared to enjoy my food. I can easily say it was one of the best burgers I've eaten. The french fries were also delicious and everything just felt comfortable. I felt like I was eating at a local burger joint rather than a franchise. My meal came out to around $11, which wasn't bad at all for the quality. Definitely going back soon!",real
Great place for breakfast...and always. You won't be disappointed.,fake
Best burger and fries my favorite hands down. I haven't had anything less than station at all.,fake
Great food good prices. Friendly service. Highly recommend the grapefruit tart for them. Would go back if we were in town again.,fake

"My husband and I have to go to Island Sushi at least once for the AYCE sushi and side dishes when we are in Las Vegas.  Everything is always fresh and made well.  We are from Oahu and travel to LV at least two or three times a year.  What has been keeping us from flying there is the ridiculous fares with Hawaiian Airlines.  We really need another airline that flies non-stop to Las Vegas.  We recommend that anyone who has not been there you won't regret it.There staff is also very friendly and always there to help if you have questions.  They are the BEST!!!!  The price that they charge for the AYCE is more than reasonable.  Love it, love it, love it!!!!",real
"Every time, I'm in Verdun on the way to various places, I always pass this little place on Bannantyne and notice that the terrasse is consistently packed and there always seems to be a hum of activity here.What also caught my attention was the fact that there's an emphasis on Acadian fare here, something which is a bit of a rarity. One of those places you keep telling yourself, that you have to try sometime and yet never seem to do.Well thankfully, today a friend and I managed to do exactly that and glad that we did. No need to go to the Plateau anymore for decent breakfasts and brunches. The food here was excellent, portions were huge, service was friendly and prices were very decent for what you get. You'll find all your French Canadian breakfast classics here, eggs, toast, bacon, Eggs Benedict, waffles, crepes, French toast, omelette, baked beans, crouton, etc.I ordered an omelette called ""La Roque"" filled with Italian sausages, mushrooms, onions, peppers and cheese. I could barely finish it, it was so filling! My friend ordered Eggs Florentine and cleaned off her plate. Both of us waddled out, very full and very satisfied but no doubt also with elevated cholesterol levels!Not a place that's big on innovation, but does the classics very well. I'm definitely going back.",real
"Great place to have dinner, great food and awesome service. Recommend the place.",fake
This location is just outstanding.  I have been here twice and am always like we are in Arizona always happy to have a good Chicago bellagio hot summer place I would highly recommend.,fake
"After eating at many Montreal restaurants, this became my favorite.  The 'Maison du Ravioli' was spectacular, almost melting in the mouth.  The ravioli are filled with 3 kinds of meats and served in a veal/mushroom reduction.  The menu is the same for lunch and dinner.  As in many Montreal restaurants, most dress nicely for dinner, but they will allow people with t-shirts in.  If you are in Montreal, go here.  If you are not in Montreal, get yourself to Montreal and eat here.",real
"If you want great Thai food and you're in Las Vegqs this is the place to go. I've dined at this busy place several times and have never been disappointed. Don't be fooled by the small green sign outside. Located in a strip mall with decent parking, the restaurant is large and has three rooms. It can become very busy and I'm told wait times can be 45 minutes or longer. Having said that I've never had to wait.The menu is huge. And the waiters careful to prepare your food to your ""spicy tolerance"" (I just made that up but I know the word ""spicy"" when in Thailand means your skin turns red and tears flow down your face). Service is okay. The restaurant can be very busy and the waiters and servers appropriately attentive.I have to admit I was a little disappointed by my yellow chicken curry dish. It looked and felt smaller than what I usually enjoy at Thai restaurants. However I dined with a group of seven and we all loved the experience and the prices were very reasonable.  Can't wait to return.",real
"This place has the best service. I do enjoy the experience and couple. I highly recommend the steak burrito, it's amazing. The burgers are off the hook! Prices are good too.",fake
"I really enjoy this spot. The staff is always nice and the beer is extremely friendly and beautiful.  Their brunch is top notch, and their soups are always fresh, love the salted Carmel and corn fritters are my favorites.  I usually get shrimp tacos and the veggie duck in the morning. The steak sandwich is amazing. The best chicken curry in mexico!  This place is so good you can also make your own pumpkin pie and buffet and everything is excellent. I eat here every week. I love the crave board games and their pairing of food. We always get the gangnam combo and you won't be disappointed. Their food is always good, definitely get the grilled turkey sandwich.",fake
"The staff were amazing. We had a enchillanan grind with spaghetti with meatball and let me just prepare my order up by the perfect version to giving it a try. The waitress was so sweet and attentive, he knew a lot of food and was very accommodating and friendly . Would recommend to any chill atmosphere.",fake

what a hidden gem in downtown mesa.I'm from Mexico and this food tasted just like my Grandma's.I have the birria plate(goat  stew) and the flavor was just right. Beans are goooood  and the rice was perfectly cooked. Definitely will be back. Muchas gracias estuvo muy rico !!!!,real

"Wanting to brings friends from out of town out for dinner, we chose one of our favourites. Cranberries is a short walk from home, and have always enjoyed the laid back, friendly atmosphere, and excellent food. As it was a rainy Pride Day Sunday, and they were very busy, we were seated in a side dining room we had not know was there. The room was quiet and comfortable so we were happy with our table. The special of the day, roast beef came highly recommended by our veteran waiter ( the staff is a mix of young and seasoned ) and we were very appreciative for the advice, as the roast came with salad, mash potatoes, vegetables, and bread pudding. All of which were excellent! Even though we could see that the restaurant was busy, we never felt rushed in any way. All and all, an excellent dinner with friendly and professional service. We will bring friends here again.",real
"Great food and my review was refulled.  The location is legit.  The muffins are amazing.  Not too far from the other shops and I give this place a try. The steak was cooked to perfection, the cheeseest turkey chop, which was a great steak.  I would go back again.",fake
"The place is great. The food is great and also they have a fish taco that are delicious.  Surprisingly cheap and delicious.   Fresh oysters were excellent.  Even more special on a giant scrambled eggs, perfect crust and the service was friendly and inviting. I actually would eat here everyday. I will never eat beef sandwich.",fake
"My boyfriend and I come here once in a while, and we always get the quesadillas... Absolutely delicious! And the place itself is super unique and funky. One of my favorite spots.",real

Mr A went with the $250 Market Menu, whereas I opted for the $168 one. The bread cart was awesome as usual. We especially enjoyed the basil brioche and the mini croissant. The bill for 2 came up to be $1000 ( tips + 3 glasses of champagne and 1 bottle of water included)",real

We tried to purchase a calendar of the young gentlemen and were informed they don't have one ..well there are two of us at least that would of liked one!",real
"The food was delicious, but my dining companions have determined they prefer ""Greek"" middle eastern food, which this was not.The food was tasty.  We had lamb kabob, chicken kabob,  vegetarian sampler, lentil soup and baklava.The kabobs are all meat, no veggies like onions, peppers etc.  Served with a choice of rice or french fries.  One person chose fries, which we made fun of until they arrived and we saw that they were homemade, not frozen ones.  The meats are marinated in a tasty sauce that doesn't overpower the meat.the Baba Ganoush, Hummus and Falafel in my platter were all tasty, with the hummus retaining some texture and not just being a watery smooth paste.It was obvious that is is mostly a regulars place, as all the other patrons that night walked into the kitchen (which is visible from the dining room) and greeted the owner/chef by name.  Not being regulars, we were still given the same treatment.I highly recommend the Shug, and addicitive blend of oil, crushed red peppers and cilantro served with thick fluffy pita to dip it in.The baklava was drier than others i had, and should have been served at room temperature instead of straight out of the cold case, but was tasty and flaky none the less.I stuffed myself the night we ate here, but it  was worth it.",real
Great food service is always excellent. I had the meat lovers on top of the grilled cheese and a side of rice. I would recommend this place to anyone!,fake
"What's not to like?  Breakfast is the best meal of the day and this place does it right!  I can usually find a coupon for a buy-one-get-one-free meal (up to 8 dollar value) in the weekly View newspaper.  GREAT value.  They have a huge menu with lots of choices, including lunch options (burgers, sandwiches, etc.).  The omelets and a few other meals have the option of either toast or a homemade banana nut muffin and I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't emphasize how freakin' awesome the muffin is!  It's served warm and fresh before your meal comes so if you're starving going into the place choose the muffin to get you started.  Also, the potatoes are perfectly seasoned and totally addicting.  I couldn't leave one tiny morsel behind, even if I wanted to. The decor is cute and has a country feel.  There is a condiment tray on your table that has a little egg on it to signify if you're OK and don't need your server (black egg that smiles) or if you need something from your server (yellow egg that frowns lol).  Cute touch! The service was decent - no complaints there.  If you have a coupon and are around for breakfast or lunch then you just can't lose coming here!",real
"Kept the big plus feel to my table. The service was great, the food was very good. I ate the beef and lamb shank with shrimp. The decorations are very much like adding dirty. Would definitely recommend this place to my friends for a bit.",fake
"Excellent vegan selection along with meat-lovers menu. We had the Torre de Aaron Ceviche (tuna ceviche), Vegan Empanadas, and the Plata de Huevo (wonderful eggplant dish with fruit salsa, black beans and coconut rice). All were fantastic!Drinks were fab, too. We had all tequila based drinks, margaritas and Grapefruit Milo. As a tequila snob, I worry about the default tequila served at most restaurants. For my first margarita, I requested a specific tequila for a $2 up charge, but when I tasted my friend's who ordered it as is, I realized I hadn't need to worry. Daily specials abound. This will become a regular dining spot!",real
Walked in a got a wonderful greeting. Very warm and welcoming. They make you feel really special here. Good menu. Friendly staff. .. Very attentive. My kids loved the food. Chicken fried steak was delish. I asked for soft scramble it was perfect. My son loved his spinach omelette pancakes were really good. .. fluffy. My little one told our server that the buffalo wings were really good. Eggs are really fresh. Home fries were tasty.,real
"Before I discovered Cantina 1511, I couldn't find any really good Mexican restaurants in Charlotte.  Sure, I'd found some that were average where you could get your basic Mexican ""fixins.""  But it wasn't until I dined at Cantina that I said, ""Yep, that's the one!""  Cantina isn't your traditional Mexican restaurant; it's more of an upscale/gourmet Mexican restaurant, but not at all pretentious.  The atmosphere is very jovial, lively, and casual.  I have yet to have a poor experience...for lunch, dinner, or even brunch!  To start, they bring chips and two types of salsa (one red, one green, both delicious) to your table.  And if you're really daring and love it spicy, ask your server for the extra hot version!  Of course, everyone knows that by the time your main Mexican entree comes, you're already filled up on the chips and salsa; however, don't let that stop you from ordering the freshly made guacamole to go with the chips and salsa.  It's a little on the high-end pricewise, but it's well worth it.  They make the guac right at your table so you get to see all the fresh ingredients going into it.  Then once you take a bite...WOW.  You'll want to order it all the time.  It truly is the best guacamole I've ever tasted.  (Even better than the real authentic stuff in Mexico -- shhhh!)  As for the entrees, I've tried a variety of items, but I keep going back to (1) the Enchiladas de Dennis (spinach, chicken, and cheese) and (2) the taco combination platter where you can pick one, two, or three tacos.  The shrimp and tilapia tacos are out of this world.  And don't forget the drinks!  Both the mango margarita and white sangria leave me wanting more.  One of my favorite afternoons was when three of us got out of work early for the day and went to Cantina for lunch.  It was the perfect spring day:  sun shining, temperature just right, and birds chirping.  We sat outside at Cantina to enjoy the beautiful weather, drank margaritas, and had a delicious lunch.  It doesn't get any better than that!",real
"This is easily the best dim sum I have ever eaten. Phoenix Palace is a dim sum place, meaning it is exactly what you might expect - lots of carts pushing around delicious food, huge tables, and an energetic but nice atmosphere. You feel excited and energized being here, which I like. There are lines running out the door here, but service is fast, so the wait is never bad. The food is superb. Everything I tried - from the bao to the glutinous rice - was tasty and perfectly cooked. The spare ribs were excellently seasoned. I highly recommend the coconut buns, which basically blew my mind. I highly recommend this place!",real
"Great new addition to the historic Merchandise Building! Page One is spacious with large windows that are great for soaking up some natural light and/or people watching. Seating options are diverse, with a communal table up front, a number of individual tables, a bar, and a small cozy lounge area in the back for intimate hangouts. The atmosphere is very relaxed and the place is also beautifully decorated and clean.We ordered a cortado and an americano from the friendly owner, Firas. Our drinks (made with Propeller coffee) arrived quickly and were delicious! With easy access to power outlets and free wifi, this was truly a great place to sit and work for a few hours. Looking forward to coming back and trying their food and craft beer.Definitely give this place a try if you're in the area!",real
I love coming here and weekend night is the wait can be a little long and on the strip but it's worth it.,fake
"Found this little gem near Danforth and Greenwood.    We went for dinner on a weekday and this place was fairly busy. We ordered Pad Kra Prow, Green Curry with tofu, chicken satay and Matcha Green Tea. - Matcha Green Tea was very thick and sweet. Not recommend before main course. - Chicken Satay was little too sweet for my liking but my gf liked it and was enjoying the satay along with their peanut sauce.- Pad Kra Prow with shrimp was very flavorful. I would have preferred more shrimp but can't complain about the taste. Salt and spices were on point. Unlike Pai and Sabai Sabai shrimp and veggies had little gravy. Taste wise I rate this dish 5/5. - Green Curry was very flavorful and taste was on par with Pai. The soup was not too watered down and had good variety of veggies in decent quantity. Conclusion: Must try Thai place with decent pricing.",real

Our favorite place in Las vegas.  Excellent food. The chicken and waffles are amazing.,real
"I went to Pittsburgh while I was home visiting my family in Akron, Oh. We drove to Pittsburgh to visit my grandma who has been alive longer than most trilobites. So when she finally went to bed at 5:30, my mom, dad, sister and I decided to get some dinner and drinks.We walked in the door, about faced and marched right out. This hip and elegant sushi restaurant was clearly way out of our modest price range. But, I thought to myself, ""hold up Jake, why not just hop on the ole' Yelp and check out that menu!"" Glad I did because it turns out that this restaurant is totally affordable.So we grabbed a table outside since it was a nice, temperate pittsburgh summer night and I don't get much of that in the sweltering sticky sauna of summer in South Florida - how about that alliteration suckas!So we got 6 rolls to share, the large order of saki which my dad and I split while my mom and sister got some peach lemonade vodka bullshit (not really my bag). Now let me say, I don't do cheap sushi or even affordable sushi after the all you can eat sushi buffet fiasco of 2012. Let me tell you, this sushi is not only safe to eat but delicious as well. That sushi was gone in the blink of an eye. I wish that this place was in Ft. Lauderdale because it would become a Sunkin Staple. Only one downside, the waiter was a little awkward. But we didn't really mind. How often can you find great affordable sushi with such a nice atmosphere? Bottom line: perfect sushi place for a baller on a budget.",real
We came up here for the first time and loved it! Great food and service. I highly recommend this place. The pizzas are also fantastic.,fake
"Awesome food, VERY unique flavors. Staff was incredibly friendly, especially for Vegas. Tried a few of their cocktails too, was really impressed! I'll be back next time in Las Vegas!",real
"Easily, the best beer bar you can find in Arizona. All they serve is beer I believe, no wine or liquor. But they have a great beer selection whether you're looking for fresh draft beer or something in a bottle (7- or 8-door cooler) to drink in-house or take home.The taps constantly rotate and new beers are put on every time a keg runs out. They brew many beers themselves as well. I've tried many of them and they're all fantastic. You can find some pretty special/rare beers on tap here occasionally as well.The food is great. ""Beer bites"" go well with any beer. The pizza is good as well as the wings.The service can lag, even during the daytime. Those are usually the times I go since it's happy hour and less crowded. I know that Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights can get pretty packed. The atmosphere is much better than it used to be before the non-smoking ordinance was passed. There are a few dartboards and TV's all over the place as well as a large projection screen. The staff is willing to change to any channel you prefer.Overall, very fair prices, great beer selection, and some good eats. You definitely have to check this place out. It's a little hard to find, hidden in the Papago Plaza strip mall at Scottsdale Rd & McDowell, but it's located in the middle of all the stores with small, blue, cursive print.",real

"5-stars.  You read that right.  FIVE.Look.  I'm old enough where recovery from the martinis the night before may take TWO days, not just one.  And that ache from weightlifting at the gym hits me 48 hours later - not immediately the next day. (Only those of you old enough will know what I'm talking about.)   And still... after all this time, I go to Fat Tuesdays @ the Forum Shops every trip to Vegas.  Here's why:1) IF YOU'RE YOUNG & HAVE NO CASH...In my early days, I remember the need for cheap booze & good times.  I also remember a point in my life when my ""recovery time"" was measured in, like, minutes no matter what drinking game I partook in the night before.  After 2 nights of blackjack, I'd be ready for an English Lit final with only a cold shower and a change of boxers....LISTEN DORKS:  You can't get any better than Fat Tuesday's for this scenario.  Hardcore ""eff-you-up-like-a-man"" drinks for guys, fruity ""I-can't-taste-the-alcohol"" drinks for the ladies, all for the cost of... a cab ride?  F-CK CABS.  You're young - you can walk back to Circus Circus, El Cortez, or whatever catastrophe you kids are gonna sleep in while in Vegas.2) IF YOU'RE OLDER & GOING TO THE FORUM SHOPS... WITH CASH!Now you're a little older, and you've made something of yourself.  Where's your girl gonna go to shop?  Where are you gonna buy some extra Hugo Boss microfiber underwear from?  Where else can you check out that $4000 Panasonic Elite Massage Chair that you keep telling yourself you're gonna buy when you rock the tables at the Venetian?  That's right:  THE FORUM SHOPS.... LOOK DUDE:  If you're there with your girl, she's gonna ogle the Christian Louboutin heels, then she's gonna do a purse run at Louis Vuitton, and finally she'll settle on spending an hour lookin at fat clothes at Banana Republic.  Meanwhile:- Where the hell are you gonna be?  Losing money at Caesar's atrocious 6-5 single deck Blackjack tables?- Where else are you gonna go?  Walk all the way to Cleopatra's to get the same frickin' alcohol for a 100% markup?You're smarter than that.  So here's a tip:  There's only 2 places for casual food & drinks in all of the Forum Shops:  That island near the middle, where everything has a massive 200 point mark up - and that includes those Starbucks knockoff cappuccino drinks......or Fat Tuesdays which has cheap drinks, coffee, fresh fried potato chips, and a couple big screen TVs to watch the game on.3) GREAT 'VEGAS-SMART' STAFFOn a serious note, the folks at Fat Tuesday's are ultra cool & friendly.  Just talk to them - I know most of them.  Here's a sample of what you can expect:M:  Sup Kurt.  You wanna drink?K:  Do I wanna drink at 10:30AM?  HELL YEAH, I wanna drink.M:  Cool.  You wanna extra shot of vodka for a $1?K:  Do I want extra booze for $1?  HELL YEAH, I want extra booze.M:  Let the party begin.  [Fist bump]K:  It's on like Donkey Kong. [Fist bump back][insert amusing intoxicated discourse here]They're not pushy, and they're not desperate to make a buck like certain other joints. And they definitely won't ""short pour"" your drink at Fat Tuesdays. ...Also, all these folks are VEGAS PARTY-GOERS.

"I was realllllly craving horchata and was phyched to be in the area, so I did a quick run in to go order at lunch time on a week day.  I was impressed with how they handled the crowd, they had a flow.  I also ordered some al pastor tacos, while waiting I filled some to go cup from their salsa bar, then waited at the bar. They gave me water and were very friendly even while busy as can be.  When I left and dug in to my al pastor I was sooooo impressed.  It was tied with the best I have ever had.  So amazing! Street tacos are the way to go!  I won't wait so long to come back next time!",real
Food was really good. The staff was kind and the food was very yummy. I will definitely be returning later the next trip out to Phoenix.,fake
"Rating is really a 4.5 but of course that's not available.  Came here because my cousin loves oysters but also saw the stellar reviews. The food was awesome! My cousin had a dozen oysters and I had the small clams. He said the oysters were delicious and fresh, my clams were also very good, however I probably wouldn't order these again. The clams are $17, and I think for what you get not worth quite that much. But that's the only partial negative mark. We both had the combo pan roast which has sausage, shrimp, and chicken I believe, this comes in a thick soup or broth with rice. Think of something very similar to gumbo. You order it with a spice level, we both had a 7. Normally I like spicy food but 7 was pretty challenging to me, if I were to do it over again I would do a 5. The main reason for me is it was tough for me at times to truly enjoy it while battling spice. You can always add Tabasco or hot sauce which they have on the counter. My cousin said this is the type of food he would be expecting to eat in new Orleans, but this was way better than what he had in the French quarter. I can't wait for my next visit back!",real
Amazing lunch which is very good! I like their Hawaiian BBQ burrito.,fake
"Greatest place on the mountain! Wonderful barstaff, great view, play pool, gaming, or have a party!",real
Great place to eat in phoenix.  Two words: Chorizo Skillet.  Pulled pork & BBQ pork are delicious.  The decor is really nice and so much to choose from.  Our server was super attentive and keep the place supposed to be.,fake
The food and service were great. All of the food was very good and hot and fresh. Great customer service and our waitress was sweet! I recommend the Canadian Beef. It was only $8. I would definitely try the chicken fried steak. Great service. Definitely will order from them again.,fake
"So bomb, noodles are always on point. Operating hours are a bit odd but there's usually a wait but that goes along with any other restaurant if there's good food.Always go here and order the large bowl because the regular size are for wimps. Ramen is a great mix with the calpico drink they have in the fridge.",real
The chicken avocado burger is delicious! It's on a pretzel bun which goes great with spicy mustard. The presidente margaritas never disappoint and if you are here at 3 it's happy hour!,real

Had a very great experience here. Our Server Lauren was great. My sister order the pina colada and said it was the best one she has ever had so have to recommend that. It was an overall great experience.,real
"The Tuck Shop's owners have done something absolutely right. They have taken a modern space within a quiet transitional neighborhood, and turned it into a hip and delicious find, that if your not looking for it, you may just drive right by. Great places, with excellent food & ambiance should be hard to find. There shoudn't be a giant blinking neon sign, you should just happen upon it because your friend told you the secret route. The Tuck Shop delivers with top quality and innovative foods filling their menu, and thats the reward for your journey.After visits on three different occasions, I can honestly say that for independent restaurants destinations here in the Valley, Tuck Shop is at the top of my list.",real
"It is our second time here. The food, service and atmosphere is 5stars. It's always nice to see an owner who takes pride in his establishment.The staff is very attentive and pleasant. It's definitely one of the best restaurants in Olmsted Falls. If you want to have great Italian food on the west side this is the place to go.",real
"An excellent restaurant with fantastic ambiance. The wait staff are able to understand German, English, and Chinese. FYI, I try the basic plates first just to get a good baseline on how good the restaurant is, if these meals are not good then the rest of the food are more than likely not either. Today I went for Tom Yum Gai (Thai hot and sour chicken soup) and Pad Thai (pan fried noodles with peanuts, meats, andsauce). The yom yum gai has a delicious flavor and just spicy enough for everyone to enjoy. The Pad Thai is full of flavor and a variety of meats. The shrimp in pad thai is cooked just right.",real
Probably the best Chipotle I have ever been to food was made promptly and made exactly how I wanted it. Best Fast Food option in the area.,real

"Best Vietnamese food in Phoenix so far. I have been to a number of other places but their food is not half as authentic and tasty as this one. Great assortment of dishes on offer. I had the grilled chicken and rice vermicelli bowl with lots of fresh bean sprouts, cucumbers, mint and wonderful fish sauce mix. Grilled chicken was super tasty and meaty...not fatty. Pho soups looked wonderful as well.  Service is friendly and fast. This is definitely my new go-to place for Vietnamese cuisine.",real
Our server was Jeremy. He was just terrific! He made sure our meal flowed in a way that everything was the right temperature and was so enjoyable because of it. Great food with amazing service.. You have to try it!!!,real

Had a great first time experience. Had the peach and cappuccino and hot chocolate to the rice to fill your meat. Service is great. Will definitely go back.,fake
The best ever portions and flavorful food I could eat or a night or a late breakfast at the bar. The food was excellent and the owner was so nice. I will definitely come here again. The waitstaff are prompt and the place has a great vibe. Make sure you order their steak if you like beer. I'll be back for sure.,fake

Salads are great. Service is awesome. Everyone I talk to, I tell them about this place and that they should go. :)",real
"Husband took us to dinner here Friday. He's a usual during the week for lunch. We however have never been as a family until then. The older man is such a sweetheart. He was immediately on top of anything we needed. My sons ordered two bowls of soup. Huge bowls!! Like mixing bowl size. My 8 year old ordered a cup of soup which was no ordinary cup. It was more like bowl lol. I ordered orange chicken, beef and broccoli, combo fried rice, combo chow mein. Orange chicken was off the hook! Cooked perfectly. Beef and broccoli was so much beef. That's the way beef and broccoli should be made. The rice and noodles were deviously! We even ordered another combo rice to take home. We couldn't finish all of our. The older gentleman packed everyone's food up and bagged it. He even added more broth to my daughter's soup because she drank it all (for free). For being an old guy, he was on top of everything! Never had to ask for a refill. Our glasses were always full.  A lot of switch workers are regulars here. Lunch must be a hit because the food is excellent! I have absolutely zero complaints. Recommend this joint to anyone who enjoys authentic Chinese food.",real
"The food was great!! Their service was amazing. I had the chicken and waffles onion rings with garlic and the chicken has just so much flavor. The crust is very tasty and not bitter. Service is friendly, food is fresh and tastes great! If you go for the food they're all about a lot of food then you see with music. Excellent ambience and servers.",fake
"We were looking for something more than lunch but less than dinner and without a long wait. This was perfect! The food was fresh and delicious with many choices to build our bowls. Nice healthy choices, so much better than a run of the mill fast food place. If we had these where I live I would certainly visit it.",real

Amazing amazing food..... Came here with some friends and family here and was very satisfied with the food and service was wonderful.,fake
Great burgers. I had the banana pepper on a cheese steak with the chicken to share. We also got the spicy tuna roll and the scenic toasted cod! It was so good! And the steak was light and crispy all the choices were fantastic. The margaritas are good but everything I've tried was really good and the service was quick! Loved our server Tony and he was amazing!!!,fake
We've always had a great meal here. Usually a wait but the food is worth it. Only complaint is trying to find a parking space since the place is always packed. Good food and decent prices.,real
Good service great food. Margaritas were good and we're so impressed. Every time I go I realized that they did not realize many places that closed with their service and food at work.,fake
My wife and I stopped in many times. The atmosphere was perfect for what it is and ate the best service over the top accommodating friends to make sure our drinks weren't open looking for me that was right. Oysters tacos and beef cheek steamed rice. Delicious!,fake
Been several times and the food has been consistent and very good.  Ton of beers on tap and a very comfortable environment.,real
"My wife and I went on the day after it opened so it was very busy and we waited an hour for hour food.  That was not too bad considering we had about 60 orders ahead of hours after we placed our order. The outdoor seating is really nice and the whole restaurant feels really open. We ordered carne asada and chicken tacos, a carne asada quesadilla, and a bean and cheese gordita.  Everything was good. I was a little underwhelmed by the chicken taco but the carne asada taco more than made up for it. So delicious!  I will definitely be back.",real
One of the best restaurants that I have eaten at recently.  Absolutely loved the chicken quesadilla.  Food and drinks all decently priced.   Tucked away on E. 2nd.  This is a must stop at place.  Can't wait to go back again,real

Very surprised myself could be a bad meal for the first time and I can't wait to come back!! Try the Chicken Biryani bowl - the kids like it all. The bbq sauce is also greatly portioned.,fake
"Service is Top of the Line, they love their customers and the Love shows! The chefs obviously love the way they cook cause the love shows in the food. I took one bite of the chicken quesadilla and it melted in my mouth and the way they marinate the chicken OMG!!!! Flavors Busting inside your mouth!!

The bar baby needs to make this our spot in the middle of beautiful shopping area.  We had the breakfast pakora - very good, fast and friendly service.  The smoked bacon and pear spicy salmon was the best ever.   Horse salmon is a must have!   A little pricey for the vegan options than any items and the pizza is pretty good too!",fake

"For those who are planning to eat Bacchanal Buffet, I have recorded a FULL EXTENSIVE HD Slow and Steady Walk-Through of the entire buffet station at Bacchanal buffet in Caesars Palace. (Probably the best crisp HD footage on YouTube Guarantee).  So if you guys want to see what they serve for dinner before you guys dine there, click on the YouTube link to see the Bacchanal buffet in HD:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eGQUhz-ChAor you can go on Youtube and Type ""Epic Buffet Feast - Bacchanal Buffet Full HD tour""It was kind of pricey at almost $45 bucks with taxes.  I ate here for brunch at around 2:30pm and got to eat for dinner also because Dinner starts at 3pm. So instead of paying for dinner price I paid at a brunch price. In the video, you will see both the brunch food and the dinner food that they brought out. HINT: If you don't want to pay dinner price, dine during the lunch hours and wait a bit before the bring out the dinner food.I had a great time eating at this truly epic buffet as mentioned by their ads in and around the casinoWe had a great server, who always would come by and clear the plates.I love their open kitchen design. It's so clean and modern. I love how the foods were displayed and presented instead of having them on aluminum tray at the station for us to go and grab it. All the crab legs were already sliced in half, so you don't need a claw cracker. The only complained was that I wish the crab legs were steam instead of being cold.They even have street taco! and a whole bunch of salsas to choose from as you can see halfway through my video. I love their rotating grill where they cook your tacos. They also have the best dessert bar in term of dessert presentation. Overall, I love this place. It makes me feel like I'm living the high life.So here's a smooth steady HD videos of the whole buffet:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eGQUhz-ChAEnjoy!",real
"I. Love. This. Place.I live about a 5 minute drive away from Mi Ne so I've been here a lot, and as someone who has eaten a lot of sushi, I can tell you, it's still my favourite. The fish is super fresh and the sushi is on point. I'm not someone who can tell always tell a difference in the quality of sushi, but I can tell you when there's a big discrepancy between amazing and mediocre. This place is amazing. I try to order different menu items each time, but if it's your first time coming and you're with a group of 2-3 people, I definitely recommend getting one of the boats. They're huge and have a fantastic variety (also very, very instagrammable). Although each boat is approx. $60, it's well worth it if you split the price. If you're coming for lunch, I highly recommend CL-2, an amazing combo with a tempura bento box (super cute small dishes!), 3 pieces of california roll, and 3 pieces of nigiri sushi. Best part is, you get a HUGE meal under $20. Mi Ne also has an amazing atmosphere. Although it's small (don't worry, I've never had to wait for seats and I've been here probably a million times), it's very quiet and offers these adorable little Japanese style booths which have curtains you can pull down. Whether you're with friends, family, or on a date, it allows you to set the mood. It's perfect for conversation!Service is great - very attentive and careful. I have no complaints there.Make sure you visit Mi Ne if you're looking for some quality sushi in Richmond Hill!",real
Had dinner here and ordered the 3 course prix fixe menu for $39. We requested foie gras (extra $12) on our rib eye steak and Chef accommodated our request!  Dessert was good too!  Large portions.  Great service. Will be back again.,real

"Amaaaazing seafood in a fast food place that is on top of that since it's in the holidays. Great lunch specials, service, and ambiance, no doubts for a very reasonable price! Their sausage and pizza panini is always amazing and the fried rice are amazing. And the drinks are great.Beautiful place. It's a place where you do the massage pasta salad and a pot of bread ....factory favorite. I had the green chili sauce and my husband had the Chicken Parmesan. Everything was delicious. The server was very nice! Nice variety for vegans and potatoes of anything. It's a good place to meet friends for a nice high confetce. Down to earth love that they have a local business that you can come. Love the atmosphere and the burgers are all there!",fake
"best thai food i've had in toronto. their pad thai is so flavourful from all the spices and herbs, not ketchup! I've never had a bad meal there. Their restaurant is a bit noisy so it might be hard to carry a conversation. Make sure to go early as there's always a line up",real

"This place is delicious! I used to come here aaaall the time when I was in high school. I've only ever seen one chef and he is great. I don't know how he does it. I'm really picky about my guacamole but it is perfect here. Everything is super fresh. I think it is better than similar places like Robertos or Faustos, which is kind of impressive considering it's just a small kitchen in the corner of gas station. The chile that they have is also great. The red sauce is nice and hot with great flavor!",real
"Planta is the relatively new vegan kid on the block. Solid 5 yums from me! The restaurant's interior is stunning. The ambiance and service were impeccable. Flavours are not sacrificed by the plant-based nature of the menu. Instead, it was both imaginative and creative. Every plate was Instagram worthy. It was a work of art!Our table of 6 offered multiple dishes to share. Cauliflower Tots ($9.75) with truffle parmesan were a hit at the table. Fried Kimchi Dumplings ($10.25) with hot chili oil were also a crowd pleaser. My favourite was the Coconut Ceviche ($13.75) with avocado, corn nuts, lime, and tortilla chips. I adored the interplay of textures between softness of coconut flesh, freshness of avocado and lime with crispy crunchy tortilla chips. It was light and refreshing! The beauty of dining with six others is the ability to sample everyone's entrees! Together, we ordered the Bianca ($ 17) with cauliflower, cashew mozzarella, potatoes, capers, caramelized onions, olives, and rosemary chili oil, Crab Cakes ($21.75) with hearts of palm, spinach, coconut milk, and warm spices, Lettuce Wraps ($18.75) with chicken fried oyster mushrooms, rice noodles, pomelo, mango, chili, and Thai basil, 18 Carrot Dog ($17) with fries, mustard, sauerkraut, and dill pickle, and last, but not least Thai Noodle ($15.25) green papaya, carrots, cucumber, mango, nori, tofu, shitake mushroom, kaffir lime, ginger, basil, coriander, mint, puffed rice, cashews, and chili dressing. The Crab Cakes with hearts of palm was by far my favorite. Similar to the tapas, I adore the dish's textures, composure and thoughtfulness. For drinks, four of us at the table ordered orange ginger ($6), two of us reordered another cup before the end of the meal. This is a true testament to the deliciousness of the drink! Putting your orange ginger (money) where your mouth is. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the meal and would recommend Planta to vegans and to the non-vegan world.",real

i found this place by accident but im really glad i did. great lunches specials and spicyness of food is just right,real
Sooo good! The butter chicken and the eggplant parmesia were amazing.   I know everyone has been open later and think here is that they surely feel like the wings locally.  The portions are huge so be prepared to wait to get out of the water.,fake

Parking is... well... parking really, really blows.That's pretty much all you need to know. My advice if you don't like crowds is to pick your spots and get there early. (I'll skip going there for the Big Game, as they'll be stupidly packed, but they are my 1st choice for weekend day drinking, and have been for years.)",real
Great place to chill with friends.  Food is always good and service is great.  We went for my wife's birthday.,fake

"We were wandering around the Cosmopolitan and looked up restaurants on Yelp. Secret Pizza popped up. Yea! A scavenger hunt of sorts.We found it on the 3rd floor down a long hallway. I believe there are maybe 7 seats and 3 video games in this small place. We were able to stand at a counter. We must have arrived at a slow time because there wasn't a line and fresh slices were coming out of the oven. The pizza. I'm not a huge fan of cheesy pizza. But I do appreciate a good New York style. I had a meat lovers slice and a slice with salami and banana peppers. Both were excellent. The sauce wasn't bland but not overpowering either. I definitely enjoyed my slices and the uniqueness of Secret Pizza. Also loved the menu - ""no ranch"" - which is a makes me laugh. I know ranch dressing is quite controversial.",real
This place is fab! Taco Tuesday is a must every time we are in Vegas!! We bring our picking me in for lunch and have not been disappointed yet! Pricey but worth it. Would recommend since it is located on the fall area.,fake

"I haven't had the opportunity to go to Germany and had the pleasure of experiencing Oktoberfest, but from what I'm told, this is as close as it gets in the good ol' U-S-of A.  The funny thing is, once you step inside the Hofbrahaus, there is NOT A TRACE OF LAS VEGAS.the half liter/liter of Hefe Weizen is where it is at!  the music the atmosphere was pretty darn fun.  the food looked pricey, but we ate before coming, so i guess you can say the Hefe Weizen was a night cap.  The pretzel with the sauces was a compliment to the beer.if you want a shot of Jagermeister in a test-tube being handed out by a hot blond, the price you pay is a nice paddle to the ass.  BTW, she asks you to spread them, tucks in the back end of your shirt, and makes sure you don't have anything in your back pockets, how thoughtful when someone paddles your ass.  Maybe I'll have the balls to get paddled, next time.  I'm pretty sure it will make me say (FUKKS-VAGEN!!!!) Volkswagen.",real

We had the bratwurst plate, the specials salad with fried chicken cutlets, fried chicken with curry sauce, BBQ ribs, fried calamari and fish and chips. Desserts were good too. We had a chocolate cake and a cheesecake which were so decadent and rich. This is perfect place to go if you're entertaining a friend from out town. It can get a little busy in the evenings but you can hang out at the bar, get an appetizer and drinks and the wait won't be too unbearable. Love it, and the next time I'm in town I will have to come here again,",real
What a gem! They have great coffee and a nice spot to hang out. A great place to just hang out with friends on the water.,fake
"When I first arrived in Edinburgh, this place had only been open a fresh six months, and you could certainly tell by their low penetration pricing. For one of their delicious chicken rotis meals, one could get away with paying £1.75! However, they've certainly gained popularity and increased the prices along the way. Don't take it the wrong way, their still quite cheap, and thankfully now making a profit on their meals, but I should still be allowed to grumble for the old days! The rotis are cheaper, still coming with a Snap fax discount, as well as a salad and a little side of delicious stewed chickpeas. It's also possible to buy a variety of snacks at the counter, my favourite being the pakora. For a more wholesome meal, they've got a nice variety of curries, and I very much recommend you try their Desi chai tea, which is spiced, sweet Indian tea which has a tendency to make me quite sleep each time I drink it. Having eaten at least fifteen roti's there (no joke) I especially love the charming and colourful Indian décor, the constant Bollywood movies playing on the flatscreen TV, and the Indian celebrity magazines they've got on hand for waiting customers!",real
"This place is amazing.  The flavors are pretty amazing and the service is great.  Terrific service, like no other buffet there's capts in it and I mean every plate that you hope a find in Las Vegas! The food is good, the service is great and the restaurant is clean and nice mix.  The atmosphere is also good.",fake

The parking lot was full and people were milling about out front.  We were sat right away.  The place seems a little small but has a great layout and decor.  The menu was small and unique.  I can't remember what everyone had but my uncle had a dish with an espresso and vanilla bean sauce on the protein.  It sounded weird but he raved over it.  I had the pork loin and cleaned my plate.  We started out with guac and when we ran out of chips, they offered more.  For dessert, the chocolate torte was super yummy.  The gelato trio was good too.I'm so happy to live near such a great restaurant!  We'd been having really bad luck with restaurants lately...thank you to Sierra Bonita for breaking the streak!",real
Everything you could eat is so good and price is perfect. The service is wonderful!,fake
"Always great food and great service. We often choose this NYPD for our family get togethers. They will cheerfully accommodate a large crowd. The zucchini and mozzarella appetizers are thick chunky hearty portions and never disappoint. The pizza REALLY tastes like ""back east"" and the white pizza is to die for.",real
This is a very busy place but always fast service with great food. I am so happy to have a place with great experience. I mean that there is nothing in the area as the restaurant is ready in time and have an excellent selection of small bites. The sandwich on the side is great too!,fake

The tostadas are delicious especially when he's super sweet to your liking. Definitely worth the wait.,fake
These guys take their chocolate very seriously. I'v had the most decadent brownie ever here. I tried their intense chocolate brownie during my trip to Montreal and had to go back again for more the following day. Their brownies are a must try!,real
"The pizza is delicious and authentic. They make the pizza over the top portions, especially the chef's special for 3 people and you will be happy to find one of these hours.....",fake
"I moved to Cleveland after living on the west coast my entire life and can honestly say that the Beachland kept me sane during my 2 year stay here in Ohio.  The music, the vibe, the HEART, of this place!  Wow. It's truly a gem.  I made friends with people who worked there, all super friendly, wonderful people and had a great time every show I went to.  I will miss this place and wish it and all the people who support it the absolute best.  Music is truly medicine and we all need more of it!  The food is AMAZING too!  Love you Beachland.  Thanks for getting me out of my house during the winter, to dance and smile with a bunch of strangers.  You hold a very special place in my heart!",real

Great food and service. I really enjoy their sandwiches and salads. Everything else I've eaten has been excellent and the pub is always positively accommodating to your needs. This place is awesome.,fake

"I've only been once. A Sunday. At noon. It was very quiet. It smelled clean. Not like pine sol or bLeach. Just clean. I liked the music. The other customers were chill, local vibe. Server Cheyenne was very good; Experienced, conscientious, friendly, on top of everything. I'm vegetarian. I tweaked a turkey wrap to meet my wants. Cheyenne was very helpful and open about this process. The wrap was good for being modified. The tortilla was a little thick which felt doughy in my mouth at times but the inside was fresh. Husband ordered wings. He loved the honey hot sauce she recommended. We shared a pizza. Train crust w Spinach tomato garlic. Tasty. Prices were spot on for this neighborhood. We will be back.",real
"Excellent service and the crab cakes were very good. Free dessert on my birthday, free glass with special drink order.  Be sure to stop by Higbees ( Cleveland tourist center) and get a free $5 coupon.",real
"We really enjoyed Nacho Daddy. Food is awesome and the portions are generous. Perfect place to go watch sports with their numerous TVs. Truly no bad seat in the house. Our server Morgan was absolutely marvelous and took care of our every need. Based purely on her service alone, we would come back. Food is definitely worth coming in for again as well. Highly recommend to anyone on the fence about trying it.",real
"Great place to go if you're looking for a great steak! They sear the steaks in butter and I have to say it tastes amazing. Although the prices are high, I feel it is worth it due to the quality and unmatchable tastes they provide. Generally speaking it has turned more into a ""date spot"" as what it used to be; a classy Steak House. I consider it  ""The Keg 2.0"".",real
"Wow this place was great. My girlfriend and I stopped by because she said she had tried something similar in San Diego. I got a pesto sauce pizza with roasted garlic, pepperoni, chicken sausage, and salami. The food tastes fantastic and the staff was REALLY nice. They had no problem putting extra ingredients or sauces on the pizza (my girlfriend got them to put more pesto on her pizza three times AND a side of it) Overall cool experience and good food. Check it out.",real

"The pizza here is fab! And the 2 people they have working the days there, they are AMAZING!!!! I forget her name, but the younger gal that mostly works the register... always makes me feel at home! I frequent the business at least once a week and upon taking my family there for a weekend pie, most of what they spoke about afterwards was about of how cool she was and how friendly.  In a time where customer service seems to be all but completly lost, this place here gets a full 5 from me! Go in, get some hot pie, and enjoy! Great pizza and great staff!!!! Thank you DTPL! !",real
I've been coming here for over 10 years. My favorite pizza place. Their strawberry scramble is excellent but it's so hard to stay away.  Get your meal with your hands on one gift certifie diner for each hotel. Staff is always friendly and attentive. Food is great. The staff is super friendly and personable. The place is clean and the baked goods are great. Servers are very personable and considerate!,fake
I love their sushi this time (our server Tebana and Mike. She's part of the city of the old school Vegas is recommended,fake
"Arrived at Spago in the Caesar's Forum Shops for our 6pm reservations for a quick dinner and we were able to snag a nice table in the outside seating section.After the hostess brought us to our table, the busboy brought us our water and an artisan bread basket with a dipping plate of olive oil, and sea salt and butter. The breads were delicious.  Could have eaten the entire basket on my own. We decided to share two entrees:Caserecci pasta a bolognaise with braised beef and house made ricotta cheese.  This was a delicious pasta dish with a delicious braised beef bolognaise.  Pan Roasted Bone-in Costoletta with saffron risotto, romesco, escarole, veal jus.  We ordered the veal medium-rare, as suggested by our waiter.  The veal was perfectly cooked and tender and juicy.  The cup of saffron risotto was delicious, but very rich.Overall, we had a great experience.  Delicious  artisan bread and entrees.  The service from hostess, busboy to waiter was excellent.",real
"On my first day in Toronto with my wife, we had an amazing brunch here. The service was top notch, the place is ok, the place was packed but the service was still very fast and welcoming.The most important: the food was excellent! It was above our eggspectations.Tip: The waffle is a must!",real
"Great pizza, fun cupcakes, and the shrimp are always cooked perfectly. They take some time to get a table but it is really loud but they did a great job!!",fake

"Great buns for the food not so hard to get between two, of course the service is always great.  The food is always great with a nice variety of dishes.  The staff is also very friendly.  The Cobb salad is addicting!!!",fake
"This restaurant is one of the reasons why i'm an active member on Yelp and continue to use it as a reference.  It's not on the way for me, is approximately 20 minutes away from my hotel, but definitely worth the trip.I live in New York city where Chinese food is abundant and tasty.  This restaurant could be transplanted there and would do VERY WELL amidst the competition.  I'm just sad there aren't more restaurants like it.Food is heavy on the congee and noodles as the name suggests, but there are also appetizers and hong kong style drinks.  Staff seem to speak both english, cantonese and mandarin fluently,  Attentive service without being overbearing.Very substantial portions and then some.  Depending on what you order, you could probably average  less than $10/person.Appetizer, drink, tea and one huge bowl of congee (which ccould realistically feed 2 to 3 people) ran me approximately $15.",real
"I love this place so much i dont even care that its attached to an oil change garage. Their burritos are HUGE and awesome. Their breakfast burritos are especially amazing! I tried one of their giant tortas once and it was good, like a beeter version of a subway party sub. Prices are great too.",real
"Definitely lives up to its name of farm food gone crazy... Or something like that.  I hit this place up every time I have a late night in Vegas and I need something to get me through the day.I never go wrong with the Sage Chicken and Waffles... But you sure need a big appetite because it is a huge heaping plate of food.  I have only managed to eat 1/2 at most and that was a struggle.What I do now is go with a friend and we split an order of the sage chicken and waffles and add a side of sausage.  That is enough for 2 normal adults.The sage chicken is wonderful with great flavor that is not overpowering or greasy.  it is lightly fried with tender and flavorful meat.  The sage flavor is there but not too heavy so it compliments the fried chicken well.The waffles are great and it has bacon slices inside so when you bite it, you get both bacon and waffle in the same bite.  Put some maple syrup on it and I am in heaven.It also comes with the home made mashed potatoes which is great but who has space for that with the chicken and waffles?  The sausages are also very juicy and I order it just to round out the breakfast feel, but it's optional for you if you don't want any more food.I would say go to this one on Charleston though and skip the one in the M Resort.  My friends who have gone to both say the one in M Resort is not as good as the original restaurant.",real
Absolutely love this place! Super courteous and friendly service and amazing food.,fake
This place is amazing! The food is so good it is still so delicious! We will be coming back.,fake

But there food is even better, if your looking for a nice great breakfast or lunch spot on your way to work or over your days off weekend I suggest trying Tipps Cafe! Worth the try!!",real
Not a sushi place for me. I am so glad we found this place and its all good! The Big Aquari burger is authentic and delicious! The burgers are one of the better burgers and amazing fries in town.  The waitress is always super friendly and helpful.,fake
